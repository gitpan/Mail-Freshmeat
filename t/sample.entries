[001] - arch 1.0pre3 (Release)
  by T Lord (http://freshmeat.net/users/tlord/)
  Friday, February 1st 2002 02:00

Software Development :: Version Control

About: arch is a revision control system with features that are ideal for
free software and open source projects characterized by widely distributed
development, concurrent support of multiple releases, and substantial
amounts of development on branches. It is intended to replace CVS and
corrects many mis-features of that system.  

Changes: In this release, past revisions can now be made available in a
(space efficient) forest of (ordinary) file system trees. There is a new
web browser for exploring the repositories.  A number of portability
glitches and minor bugs have been fixed, including a serious security bug
in with-ftp.

Changes: Demo source code was added, and usage instructions were improved.

[022] - Ganglia Cluster Toolkit 2.0.3 (Monitoring core)
  by Matt Massie (http://freshmeat.net/users/gaiafractal/)

System :: Clustering/Distributed Networks System :: Logging System ::
Monitoring

About: Ganglia is a massively scalable cluster monitoring   and execution
environment written at the   University of California, Berkeley Computer
Science   division as part of the Millennium Project. Ganglia   monitors
over 25 core host metrics (such as CPU,   load and memory) and any number
of custom   metrics on clusters with hundreds of nodes. Clients   can plug
into the Ganglia monitoring core via an   XML interface to generate a
multitude of useful   visualizations. rrdtool is the tool of choice for Web
  visualization of cluster status and historical trends. 

Changes: Increased speed of the host security check for the XML port, new
commandline options for almost all compile-time gmond options, a new
--safe_host option to allow a host outside of the multicast  channel to
connect , stripping all quotes (") from gmetric data to keep XML
well-formed, and improved self-organizing behavior of the gmonds.

rotation, and a new "shtool subst" command for a convenient way to apply
multiple text substitutions to multiple files at once. This release has

  Friday, February 1st 2002 22:20

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries Software
Development :: Libraries

About: The HTML::Template module attempts to make using HTML templates
simple and natural. It extends standard HTML with a few new tags for
variables, loops, if/else blocks and includes. A file written with HTML and
these new tags is called a template. Using this module you fill in the
values for the variables and loops declared in the template. This allows
you to seperate design (the HTML) from the data, which you generate in the
Perl script. While there are many other HTML template systems available,
this module is simple and fast. It doesn't try to reinvent Perl CGI, it
just augments HTML with a few new and very useful abilities.

Changes: Bugfixes, documentation cleanups, and a new project Web site.

error with large sites and bogus HTTP-referer with protected sites. The
'K4' option now works, the option --continue+URL(s) now clears previous
URLs, and there are fixes for various parsing bugs. Several new options

[058] - Organon 0.5.1 (Stable)
  by Basilios (http://freshmeat.net/users/basilios/)
  Friday, February 1st 2002 06:27

Software Development Software Development :: Build Tools

About: Organon is a project manager that uses the Perl/Tk module. It is
written for those who use stand-alone editors to write their code but would
like to have a tool to manage the file groups they work with. It can be
used with any programming language, and it can be easily tailored to match
your needs. You can configure the standard tools (dedicated to editing,
compilation, and execution), and you can define any number of new user
tools. Each tool (standard or user-defined) is associated with a string
containing shell commands to be executed. 

Changes: Organon can now run projects and execute tools in a terminal
window. The terminal emulator can be defined in the Configure Standard
Tools dialog. The way to define Organon's behavior when capturing stdout
and stderr for standard and user-defined tools is now more flexible: there
is a drop-down menu instead of a group of checkboxes. Finally, the "--path"
command-line switch can now be used to choose a path in which to open the
first project of the session.

Multimedia :: Graphics :: Presentation Scientific/Engineering ::
Visualization

About: PLplot is a library of C functions that are useful for making
scientific plots from programs written in C, C++, Fortran, Octave, Python,
and Tcl/Tk.  It can be used to create standard x-y plots, semi-log plots,
log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, shade (gray-scale and color) plots,
mesh plots, bar charts, and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or
different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
graph. Different line styles, widths, and colors are supported. A virtually
infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used. There are
almost 1,000 characters in the extended character set, including four
different fonts, the Greek alphabet, and a host of mathematical, musical,
and other symbols. The fonts can be scaled to any desired size. A variety
of output devices and file formats are supported, including a metafile
format which can be subsequently rendered to any device/file. New devices
and file formats can be easily added by writing a driver routine. 

Changes: This release works on a wide variety of platforms. There are good
reports for Windows systems (98, NT, and 2000), Mac OS X, several Unix
systems, and of course for Linux. It also has expanded examples, improved
documentation, dynamically loadable device drivers (including a new
Computer Graphics Metafile driver), and experimental versions of an image
plotting function, a PyQT GUI, and a Java front end.

Database Database :: Front-Ends Internet :: WWW/HTTP

About: Zaval Database Front-end is a light and functional  Web-based
front-end to any database for which you have JDBC drivers. It allows raw
SQL code execution and is limited only by the extent of the database's SQL
support. It supports multiple  query execution, alternate languages, and
more.

Changes: This release introduces a file upload and queries execution
feature, and a simple filename change feature. A problem with HTML code
representation in browser on select queries was fixed, as was a problem
with correct query encoding representation after query execution (encodings
different from ISO-8859-1).
