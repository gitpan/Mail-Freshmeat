easy to use and powerful at the same time.  

Changes: A new, more powerful project file format, a new project manager
for the new file format, a fix for a workaround for the file transfer, a
fix for a loading bug, the exportscript engine works with the new file
format, and some changes in the testeditor.

[003] - Android 0.99.8
  by Larry (http://freshmeat.net/users/talespinner/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 14:11

Category: Software Development :: Testing

About: Android is a tool for recording and playing back scripts of X11
events. It uses the XTest extension to send synthetic input events to any
specified X-server. It is an extension to the TCL/Tk shell language.
Android provides a "follow me" facility that will write the script for a
particular series of events as you show the system what to do.

Changes: This release contains minor fixes for configure and dispinfo
command. There is a new corporate sponsor, and so real support is now being
offered.

  by astaro (http://freshmeat.net/users/astaro/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 06:12

Category: System :: Networking :: Firewalls

About: Astaro Security Linux is a firewall solution. It does stateful
packet inspection filtering, content filtering, user authentication, virus
scanning, VPN with IPSec and PPTP, and much more. With its Web-based
management tool, WebAdmin, and the ability to pull updates via the

[009] - Cascade 1.9.8
  by Mark Stosberg (http://freshmeat.net/users/markjugg/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 06:04

Categories: Database, Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content, Internet ::
WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: Cascade is a Web-based content management system. It's based around
the idea of organizing resources into a hierachy of categories, much like
Yahoo. Some features include generating static or dynamic HTML, allowing

[010] - cgipaf 1.0rc2
  by staf (http://freshmeat.net/users/stafwag/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 20:11

Category: Communications :: Email

About: cgipaf is a combination of three CGI programs. passwd.cgi, which
allow users to update their password, viewmailcfg.cgi, which allows users
to view their current mail configuration, and mailcfg.cgi, which updates
the mail configuration. All programs use PAM for user authentication. It is
possible to run a script to update SAMBA passwords or NIS configuration
when a password is changed. mailcfg.cgi creates a .procmailrc in the user's
home directory. A user with too many invalid logins can be locked. The
minimum and maximum UID can be set in the configuration file, so you can
specify a range of UIDs that are allowed to use cgipaf.  

Changes: Syslog messages, and a fix for configure on non-PAM systems.

[011] - chrony 1.16
  by Richard Curnow (http://freshmeat.net/users/rcurnow/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 18:40

Category: System :: Systems Administration

About: chrony is a pair of programs for keeping computer clocks accurate.
chronyd is a background (daemon) program and chronyc is a command-line
interface to it. Time reference sources for chronyd can be RFC1305 NTP
servers, human (via keyboard and chronyc), or the computer's real-time
clock at boot time (Linux only). chronyd can determine the rate at which
the computer gains or loses time and compensate for it while no external
reference is present. Its use of NTP servers can be switched on and off
(through chronyc) to support computers with dial-up/intermittent access to
the Internet, and it can also act as an RFC1305-compatible NTP server.

Changes: A fix for behaviour in Solaris 2.6+, changing the timestamp format
in log files to be fully numeric, a fix for a bug when keyfile lacked a
final newline, and a new option to show more header information on
chronyc's sources and sourcestats commands.

[012] - ETC M621 and M221 DOCP 0.4 beta (Development)
  by Peter Arbet (http://freshmeat.net/users/arbet/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 14:14

Category: Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: ETC M621 and M221 DOCP is used to control ETC  M621 (or M221)
digital oscilloscopes under Linux in  X.

Changes: This release contains data load and save for Continuous mode, a
Compensation Generator (for M621), and data saving in gnuplot format for
Before Trigger mode and After Trigger mode. Some bugs have been removed.

[013] - f2html.pl 0.3
  by nikolei (http://freshmeat.net/users/nikolei/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 12:29

About: f2html.pl is a command line utility that searches recursively
through directories, builds a file list (with additional file information),
sorts this filelist alphabetically by the filenames, not by the name of the
directory they are stored in, and generates html files. The output can be
controlled, links can be corrected, and more. The script is mainly desigend
to create Web pages, playlists, and databases for mp3-files, but can also
used for other purposes.

Changes: Some checks and corrections for pathnames, only existing
characters are written out at the top of an HTML file, a rewrite of
files/sizes sums (important for writing seperate HTML files for every
character, a new option -q that allows for doing the procedures in a
non-case-sensitive way, an option -j, and an HTML file with statistics can
be written out.

[014] - FreeBSD 4.4-RELEASE
  by David Hill (http://freshmeat.net/users/ocipio/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 13:28

About: Briefly, FreeBSD is a UNIX operating system based on U.C. Berkeley's
4.4BSD-lite release for the i386 platform (and recently the alpha
platform). It is also based indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C.
Berkeley's Net/2 to the i386, known as 386BSD, though very little of the
386BSD code remains. A fuller description of what FreeBSD is and how it can
work for you may be found on the FreeBSD home page.

Changes: Major userland, security, and kernel changes.

[015] - FreeJ 0.2.1 (Stable)
  by jaromil (http://freshmeat.net/users/jaromil/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 13:03

Categories: Games/Entertainment, Multimedia, Multimedia :: Video,
Multimedia :: Video :: Capture, Multimedia :: Video :: Display,
Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: FreeJ is a digital instrument for video livesets, featuring realtime
rendering of multilayered video and chained effect filtering directly on
the screen. It treats every video source as a layer, making it possible to
dynamically apply on each a chain of filters, loadable as effect plugins
and easily customizable. Layers are planned for rendering of analog video
input, digital movie files, image bitmaps, sound scopes, texts and
eventually more. 

Changes: Better performance and overall stability due to a total rewrite of
the multithreaded mechanism, new user-friendly commandline options, a new
small asm filter coding example, and some other bugfixes and code cleanup.

[016] - Freenet 0.4-snapshots
  by Ian Clarke (http://freshmeat.net/users/sanity/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 21:14

Categories: Communications, Internet

About: Freenet is a peer-to-peer network designed to allow the distribution
of information over the Internet in an efficient manner, without fear of
censorship. It is completely decentralized (there is no person or computer
essential to its operation), meaning that Freenet cannot be attacked like
centralized peer-to-peer systems such as Napster. Freenet also employs
intelligent routing and caching to learn to route requests more
efficiently, automatically mirror popular data, make network flooding
almost impossible, and move data to where it is in greatest demand.

Changes: Due to rapid progress of the 0.4 development branch, daily Linux
snapshots (and less-fequent, auto-updating Windows snapshots) are being
released.

[017] - Functionally Overloaded Linux Kernel 2.4.9-folk2.2.5
  by imipak (http://freshmeat.net/users/imipak/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 18:17

Categories: Software Development, System :: Clustering/Distributed
Networks, System :: Operating System Kernels :: Linux

About: The FOLK project aims to provide a single patch which incorporates
as many Linux kernel projects as can be crammed in. Its goal is to allow
people who are interested in experimenting with the different projects to
get on with the experimenting, rather than spend time fixing clashing
diffs. It also has the goal of giving some of the more obscure projects a
better chance of being seen and used. It is not intended for "general use".
If a given release is stable, that will be by sheer luck. These are
experimental projects, of unknown quality and completeness, being thrown
together in ways that the developers are unlikely to have even remotely
considered. 

Changes: Two new VME drivers, merging of KGI, korbot, and ppscsi, merging
up to Alan Cox's 2.4.9-ac12, and updates to VAX architecture, JFS, XFS,
i2c/lm_sensors, and badmem.

[018] - g4u 1.7
  by hubertf (http://freshmeat.net/users/hubertf/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 13:24

Categories: System :: Archiving :: Backup, System :: Installation/Setup,
System :: Systems Administration

About: g4u ("ghost for unix") is a bootfloppy that allows one to easily
clone PC harddisks by using FTP. This is often done to deploy a common
setup on a number of PCs. The floppy offers two functions: it uploads the
compressed image of a local harddisk to a FTP server, and then it can
retrieve that image via FTP, uncompress it, and write it back to disk. 
Network configuration is fetched via DHCP. As the harddisk is processes as
a image, any filesystem and operating system can be deployed using g4u.   

Changes: An update to accomodate latest drivers and kernel features from
NetBSD 1.5.2, new documentation about disk sizes, removal of the Token Ring
driver, improvements to the greeting message of g4u with instructions, and
a kernel config on the Web site for documentation of supported device
drivers.

[019] - gbiff 2.6
  by Nicolas Rougier (http://freshmeat.net/users/nicolasrougier/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 14:24

Category: Communications :: Email

About: gbiff checks for mail within a file, in a qmail or MH style dir, or
on an IMAP4 or POP3 server, and can display headers (number, sender,
subject, and date) when new mail has arrived. It also interprets any

[061] - psycopg 0.99.7 (Stable)
  by Federico Di Gregorio (http://freshmeat.net/users/fog/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 13:33

Categories: Database, Software Development :: Libraries

About: psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming
language (just like pygresql and popy). Its main advantages are that it
supports the full Python DBAPI 2.0 and it is thread safe at level 2. It was
designed for heavily multi-threaded applications that create and destroy
lots of cursors and make a conspicuous number of concurrent INSERTs or
UPDATEs. The psycopg distribution includes ZPsycopgDA, a Zope Database
Adapter.

Changes: A fix for the None->NULL problem, transactions are closed when
unneeded, an fix for a problem with the mxDateTime module, PostgreSQL time
intervals are correctly casted into DateTimeInterval objects, a new
lastoid() method, and better binary objects performance (they use less
memory too).

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers, System :: Networking

About: pyproxy is a combined TCP and ICP to ICMP mapping proxy implemented
in Python. The TCP  proxy is a basic TCP forwarding proxy. The ICP to  ICMP
mapping proxy converts incoming ICP queries to ICMP pings, returning ICP
MISS responses when  the ping returns. pyproxy is designed primarily to
allow squid to use  ICP load balancing to upstream proxies that don't 
allow or support ICP or UDP echo.

Changes: Code taken from "ping and traceroute for Python" was simplified
and updated for Python 1.5.2, fixing some potential bugs.

whole sound file and hand back a single pointer to the waveform, or
SDL_sound can process sound data in programmer-specified blocks when
resource constraints are a concern. SDL_sound can also handle sample rate,
audio format, and channel conversion on-the-fly.

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content, Internet :: WWW/HTTP
:: HTTP Servers, Software Development :: Object Brokering :: CORBA

About: The SOAP to CORBA bridge/translator is written entirely in C++ and
shows that it is indeed possible to do a generic translation of SOAP
requests to CORBA method invocations and vice versa. This is implemented by
using the CORBA Interface repository to match the incoming SOAP request to
the corresponding CORBA service, build the dynamic invocation of the CORBA
service, and generate the SOAP response (or possibly SOAP fault in the case
of a CORBA user exception, for instance). 

Changes: Issue with order of the SOAP head and body parts being reversed in
the SOAP response was fixed.

[076] - Vandermonde Forward Error Correction 1.0
  by Dr. Tom (http://freshmeat.net/users/professortom/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 16:19

Categories: System :: Archiving :: Backup, System :: Recovery Tools

About: VDMFEC implements Block ECC using a Forward Error Correction (FEC)
code based on Vandermonde (VDM) matrices in GF(2^8) due to Luigi Rizzo.
Given the FEC parameters K and N, with N greater than K, N blocks are
written for every K input blocks in such a way that any K blocks are
sufficient to reconstruct the data. That is, up to N - K blocks out of
every group of N blocks may be lost without loss of data. VDMFEC's primary
application is intended to be in recovering data from unreliable media such
as diskettes. With appropriate parameters, files may be recovered even with
many read errors. (Note that you must write the data to the diskette using
this program in order to be able to recover the data later!)

[077] - xclip 0.06
  by Kim Saunders (http://freshmeat.net/users/snaund/)
  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 12:34

Category: Text Processing

About: xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any
system with an X11 implementation. It provides an interface to X selections
("the clipboard") from the command line. It can read data from standard in
or a file and place it in an X selection for pasting into other X
applications. xclip can also print an X selection to standard out, which
can then be redirected to a file or another program.

Changes: Support for the INCR mechanism (-o should be able to print out
selections that were previously too big and would have resulted in a
message "Error: Support for format not yet implemented."). In in mode,
using the INCR mechanism means that you can use xclip on really big data.
It used to work OK on big data, but it is better behaved about it.

  Wednesday, September 19th 2001 06:03

About: XML parser class is a PHP class that parses arbitrary XML input and
builds an array with  the structure of all tag  and data elements.
Optionally it can keep track of the positions of each element to locate 
elements that may be contextually in error.  Supports a parsed file cache
to minimize the overhead of parsing the same file repeatedly.  Optimized
parsing of simplified XML (SML) formats ignoring the tag attributes.

Changes: Parsing was optimized by avoiding copy of parsed document
structure from the parser handler to the parser object. Passing arguments
by reference avoided to prevent warnings.

Category: Communications :: Chat

About: ARSC Really Simple Chat is a Web chat system that uses PHP and

as operators, kick-ing, whispering, and more. Multiple rooms and different
languages are available. To run ARSC on your site, you need a Web server
that understands PHP, and can connect to a MySQL database.

Changes: A socket server was added (to allow better chat performance, and
less RAM and CPU usage) using the new pcntl feature of PHP4.0.7RC2, as well
as some chat commands. Many minor bugs were fixed, so compatibility with
every browser around has become a reality.

About: Java Serialization to XML is a tool that XML-enables applications in
just two lines of code, by reimplementing the standard Serialization API to
work with XML. It works for all objects out-of-the-box (no parsing, no
schemas, and no re-coding).

Changes: Exceptions are now reported much more cleanly, especially
ClassNotFoundException, and parsing exceptions.

[025] - JSwat Java Debugger 1.4.2
  by Nathan Fiedler (http://freshmeat.net/users/nfiedler/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 00:35

Category: Software Development :: Debuggers

About: jswat is a graphical, stand-alone Java debugger, using the JPDA
library. It offers all of the basic features you would expect from a

Changes: Simple conditionals for breakpoints, where the condition is
satisfied when a variable equals a value, and dialogs for setting the
classpath and sourcepath have been added. The classpath no longer
automatically appears in the "Start VM" dialog, so the program can tell if
you entered it or not.

  by Ben Martin (http://freshmeat.net/users/monkeyiq/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 11:50

Categories: Software Development :: Libraries, System :: Filesystems

About: libferris is a virtual filesystem that exposes hierarchical data of
all kinds through a common C++ interface. Access to data is performed using
C++ IOStreams and Extended Attributes (EA) can be attached to each datum to
present metadata. Ferris uses a plugin API to read various data sources and
expose them as contexts and to generate interesting EA. Current
implementations include Native (kernel disk IO with event updates using
fam), xml (mount an xml file as a filesystem), edb (mount a berkeley
database), ffilter (mount an LDAP filter string) and mbox (mount your
mailbox). EA generators include image, audio, and animation decoders. 

Changes: Support was added for sorting by string, numeric sorting, and
reverse sorting. The ls client was extended to use the new sorting API.

  Monday, October 1st 2001 14:32

About: Lilo is a Boot loader for Linux/x86 and other PC operating systems.
Lilo is responsible for loading your Linux kernel from either a floppy or a
hard drive and giving it control of the system. It can also be used to boot
many other operating sysetms, including the BSD variants, DOS, and OS/2.
The Lilo distribution includes full source, documentation and support
files, but no pre-compiled binaries. Lilo is capable of booting beyond
cylinder 1024 of a hard disk if the BIOS supports EDD packet call
extensions to the int 0x13 interface.

Changes: A graphical user interface using VGA 640x480x16 (mode 0x12) has
been added. Secure passwords have been implemented using four CRC-32
polynomials. RAID1 codes are completely re-written, and correctly implement
'lock', 'fallback', and 'lilo -R'. The new RAID1 implementation is not
compatible with version 21. Those using version 21 should read
'README.raid1' before installing these new codes. There is a compatibility
mode for existing RAID1 installations which are not going to be converted
to the new implementation.

Categories: Database :: Front-Ends, Software Development :: Libraries

About: pyPgSQL is a package of two modules that provide a Python DB-API 2.0
compliant interface to PostgreSQL databases. The first module, libpq,
exports the PostgreSQL C API to Python. This module is written in C, and
can be compiled into Python, or can be dynamically loaded on demand. The
second module, PgSQL, provides the DB-API 2.0 compliant interface, and
support for various PostgreSQL data types, such as INT8, NUMERIC, MONEY,
BOOL, ARRAYS, BYTEA, etc. This module is written in Python, and works with
PostgreSQL 7.0 or later, and Python 2.0 or later. Use of Python 2.1 or
later, and PostgreSQL 7.1 or later is highly recommended. NB: pyPgSQL was
previously released under the name 'PgSQL'. 

Changes: pyPgSQL 1.6 adds support for PostgreSQL's BYTEA type. It also
corrects problems with escaping/quoting strings that use alternate
character encodings. Also, there have also been numerous bug fixes made in
little used methods in the libpq module.

the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It provides an easy-to-use Java
library that can be used as a basis for component-oriented application
development following the layered architecture detailed in Sun's J2EE and
in Cheesman/Daniels: UML Components. Scope ships with two View
implementations: one for Swing GUIs and one for servlet deployments. It has
been used commercially as a foundation for development of a VoiceXML UI. 

Changes: This is a minor release, mainly to bring documentation and samples
up to date, and to start the final refactor of the servlet implementation.
The servlet docs are still lacking, and will be until that subsystem
stabilises.

[057] - SpamAssassin 1.2
  by Justin Mason (http://freshmeat.net/users/jmason/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 06:10

Category: Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: SpamAssassin is a mail filter that uses a wide range of heuristic
tests on mail headers and body text to identify spam.  Once identified, the
mail can then be optionally  tagged as spam for later filtering using the
user's  own mail user-agent application.   It provides a command line tool
to  perform filtering, along with Mail::SpamAssassin, a set of Perl modules
which implement a Mail::Audit  plugin, allowing SpamAssassin to be used in
a  Mail::Audit filter or in a spam-protection proxy POP/IMAP server.   

Changes: Some new tests were added, as well as MIME header decoding. Some
tests were rescored, based on statistical analysis of a large mail spool,
and several tests were fixed to provide better scoring. spamassassin -d now
only removes body lines inside the report, not in the mail in general.
Memory usage has been reduced on really big mails.

[059] - Spirit Parser library 1.2.0rc1
  by Dan Nuffer (http://freshmeat.net/users/nuffer/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 11:52

Categories: Software Development :: Code Generators, Software Development
:: Compilers, Software Development :: Interpreters, Software Development ::
Libraries

About: Spirit is an object-oriented, recursive descent parser generator
framework implemented using template meta-programming techniques.
Expression templates allow Spirit to approximate the syntax of Extended
Backus Normal Form (EBNF) completely in C++. The Spirit framework enables a
target grammar to be written exclusively in C++. EBNF grammar
specifications can mix freely with other C++ code and, thanks to the
generative power of C++ templates, are immediately executable.

Changes: New features include character sets, symbol tables, an STL-like
iterator interface, more examples, debugging output, numeric parsers, and
string parsers.

Category: Internet :: WWW/HTTP

About: SwiftSurf is an HTTP proxy that lets you do a lot of things. You can
spy, filter, and modify the HTTP requests that your browser sends, as well
as the answers it receives. Some of its possible uses include filtering
ads, limiting access to a specific domain, or suppressing cookies.

Changes: This release includes HTTP/1.1 compliance (though not in the most
efficient way). This enables the use of Mozilla without special
configuration.

[063] - Text::EtText 2.2

  Monday, October 1st 2001 06:11

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries,
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: EtText is a simple plain-text format which allows conversion to and
from HTML. It provides an easy-to-edit, easy-to-read and intuitive way to
write HTML, based on plain-text markup conventions.  Like most simple text
markup formats (POD, setext, etc.), EtText markup handles the usual things:
insertion of paragraph tags, header recognition, and markup. However it
also adds a powerful link markup system, and tries to generate code which
conforms to XHTML. 

Changes: Hn headers now have autogenerated id attributes, as well as name
attributes for XHTML conformance. The list handling code was rewritten from
scratch to match txt2html's capabilities. An optional new link format was
added, using double-square-brackets, to reduce mangling of third-party text
that contains quotes, or square brackets.

[065] - Tiny SRP 0.7.5
  by Dr. Tom (http://freshmeat.net/users/professortom/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 11:18

Categories: Communications, Internet, Security, Software Development ::
Libraries

About: The Tiny SRP library is a stripped-down version of srp-1.7.1 and
openssl-0.9.6 that contains only what is necessary for secure remote
passphrase authentication. No other libraries are required. If you already
have libsrp installed on both server and client then you don't need this.
Tiny SRP is designed for embedded or mini distributions, and is also a
quick and easy way to add secure authentication to small client/server
projects. Also included is the TSRP protocol, which reduces socket
authentication to one function call on each of the client and server.

Changes: A missing initialization in tconf was fixed.

[066] - Turbo Vision 1.1.2 (Beta)
  by Salvador Eduardo Tropea (SET) (http://freshmeat.net/users/setsoft/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 13:20

Category: Software Development :: Libraries :: Application Frameworks

About: Turbo Vision is a C++ library that provides a very nice user
interface for console applications. This UNIX port is based on Borland's
version 2.0 with fixes. It was made to create RHIDE, a nice IDE for gcc and
other GNU compilers. The library supports /dev/vcsa devices for fast access
to local consoles, and it uses ncurses to run from telnet and xterm. This
port, in contrast to the Sigala's port, doesn't have "100% compatibility
with the original library" as goal. Instead, many modifications were made
for the sake of security (especially buffer overflows). This port is also
available for the original platform (DOS). 

Changes: Fixes for endianness problems (mouse, shadows, and keyboard),
testing with Linux/PPC and Linux/SPARC, and new support for CygWin (Win32)
and gcc 3.x (the demo and tutorial hit a bug in libstdc++ v3).

  by aurlio marinho jargas (http://freshmeat.net/users/verde666/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 20:17

Category: Other/Nonlisted Topic

About: txt2tags is a generic text converter that generates  HTML, sgml,
Magic Point (mgp), MoinMoin, and  Adobe PageMaker documents from simple
text files.  Any other marked up language can be added. It is  in Python,
so no external commands or libraries are  needed.

Changes: A new 'man' target document, and a nice shell wrapper to deal with
files/directories/options (in fact, the Python code is now "embedded" in
the shell script).

[068] - uDHCP Server/Client 0.9.6
  by Russ Dill (http://freshmeat.net/users/r2600/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 15:50

Category: System :: Networking

About: uDHCP Server/Client is an embedded DHCP client  and server that can
be compiled seperately (17k  each), or as one combined binary (25k). The
server  stores its lease file periodically, or by a signal (for  systems
with flash memory) in terms of absolute  time of lease expiration, or time
remaining in a lease  (for systems with no clocks). The client calls helper
 scripts to do the work of configuring the interfaces  for more
flexibility.

Changes: bootp paramater support was added to both the server and the
client. The client now adds a vendor id to each request. Pidfile handling
is improved and standardized across the client and server. Man pages were
added to the client and server.

[070] - vmail-sql 0.5
  by Chris Lightfoot (http://freshmeat.net/users/chrisexparrotcom/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 20:13

Categories: Communications :: Email, Communications :: Email :: Post-Office
:: POP3

About: vmail-sql is a complete virtual domains email setup, including
sample Exim configuration sections, reference to tpop3d which will
authenticate access to mailspools against the virtual user database, a set
of admin-level scripts for administrating domains, and a Web-based control
panel. Rather than storing the virtual domains setup in flat text files, it
uses a MySQL database, allowing flexible administration strategies without
concurrency hassles. It is designed for use in environments where several
virtual domains are operated from a single machine/IP address.

Changes: Widened primary keys in the database, fixes for various uniqueness
problems, support for domain aliasing, and a fix for an unfortunate
security blunder in the passwd_popbox script.

Categories: Desktop Environment :: Gnome, Multimedia :: Sound/Audio

About: Walk500 is a Rio500 management tool for the Gnome desktop. It is a
replacement tool for all the rio500-related command-line utilities.

Changes: A lot of bugs have been fixed (including the "adding song"
segfault), memory leaks have been shut, and UI enhancements have been made.
libglade is now required. Upgrading is strongly recommended.

[072] - WebMake 2.2
  by Justin Mason (http://freshmeat.net/users/jmason/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 06:14

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP, Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management,
Text Processing :: Markup

About: WebMake is a simple Web site management system, allowing an entire
site to be created from an optional set of text and markup files and one
WebMake file. It requires no dynamic scripting capabilities on the server,
and can be run entirely offline. It allows the separation of
responsibilities between content editors, page designers, and the site
architect. Only the site architect needs to edit the WebMake file itself,
or know Perl or WebMake code. Perl scripts can be embedded and executed to
build pages. Automatic dependency tracking means that pages will not be
rebuilt unless necessary. Metadata support means that indexes etc. can be
built automatically.

Changes: 'Concepts' documentation has been added, along with a wmview.cgi
(a single-page-viewer CGI script to allow viewing WebMake output without
having to pregenerate it), parameterised references (e.g. ${template:
body=foo}), a thumbnail tag to support image galleries, and a 'skip'
attribute for data sources. Media files now pick up implicit titles from
their filenames, and data sources can now pick up metadata from metatable
files within the directory tree. Some bugs have been fixed.

  by cliff (http://freshmeat.net/users/iamcliff/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 00:04

Category: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Capture/Recording

About: xmcd2make is a set of Perl scripts which support users of the
gramofile recording, track splitting, and signal processing package.   It
consists of 3 userland tools: findtracks.pl (a command line interface to
gramofile track detection), signalproc.pl (a command line interface to
gramofile track splitting and signal processing), and xmcd2make.pl (a
script that takes an xmcd file of song names and track timing files and
creates a makefile).  When the makefile is run, it splits the tracks,
performs gramofile signal processing, and encodes the resulting tracks to
Ogg Vorbis format with the correct song names and good tags.      

Changes: Support has been added for ripping CDs using cdparanoia.

  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 22:08

Category: Games/Entertainment

About: Agendaroids is a game where you maneuver a space ship in a field of
asteroids, and shoot at them to break them into smaller pieces. It uses
vector-based graphics with fixed-point trigonometry, so it runs well even
on the FPU-less VR3, but it also runs on any other Xlib-based system. 

Changes: A new high score feature, a pause/resume feature, saving paused
games when you quit, thrust momentum slows over time (easier movement), and
bonus lives every 10,000 points.

[006] - Database Abstraction Layer 0.2.5
  by Patrick van Zweden (http://freshmeat.net/users/pvzweden/)
  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 15:50

Category: Database :: Front-Ends

About: Database Abstraction Layer is a project to produce a general way to
access databases from within PHP. The DAL class takes care of the
administration involved with the different kinds of databases. DAL is
extendible via plugins so support for different dbms' can be added
dynamicly.  Also switching from one DBMS to another is simple because not
very much has to be altered to support the new DBMS.

Changes: A patch for a bug in the MySQL driver which prevents the
fetchlastinsert function from getting confused by commas in the input for
the database table.

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries,
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers, Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site
Management, Software Development :: Build Tools, Software Development ::
Libraries :: Application Frameworks

About: HyperQbs is an open servlet framework for rapid application
development of enterprise-scale Web applications based on visual components
for the Java 2 platform. HyperQbs encourages application architectures
based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) designs paradigm and complies with
the JavaServer Faces (JSR-127) design goals. HyperQbs increases
productivity and allows teamwork, fast prototyping, and incremental
life-cycle development from reusable plug-in components. HyperQbs provides
support for any J2EE and XML-based application server and development
environment. The Configurable Application Flow (CAF) rule engine enables
tailor-made component assembly without touching a single line of the
component's source code, while the "dynamic face" effect makes your Web
application independent of any user interface protocol.

Changes: Performance and stability enhancements, improved logging
information, support for error handling via a 'SystemErrorPage', and a
re-worked demo application 'shop' were added. Authentication was added to
the HyperQbs administration console, 'hqService' interface was extended,
and minor bugs were fixed in the deployment tool and in the plug-in for the
XML editor Merlot.

Categories: Internet, Multimedia :: Graphics :: Graphics Conversion, System
:: Logging, System :: Networking, System :: Networking :: Monitoring, Text

About: PAIP (pipe) is a universal filter application. It uses plugins to
transmit and convert data. The plugins can be nested, so the inner
structures can become quite complex (non-linear). The command-line
interface is similar to human language and is quite easy to use.

Changes: Makefiles have been fixed, the plugin 'socket' has been extended
with the 'connections' switch, and two new using-plugins (jpg2bmp and
gif2bmp) have been added.

About: Postfix is an attempt to provide an alternative to the widely-used
Sendmail program. Postfix attempts to be fast, easy to administer, and
hopefully secure, while at the same time being sendmail compatible enough
to not upset your users.

[052] - rdiff-backup 0.3.2
  by Ben Escoto (http://freshmeat.net/users/bescoto/)
  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 22:11

Category: System :: Archiving :: Backup

About: rdiff-backup backs up one directory to  another.  The target
directory ends up a copy of the  source  directory, but extra reverse diffs
are stored in  the  target directory so you can still recover files lost  
some time ago. The idea is to combine the best   features of a mirror and
an incremental backup.   rdiff-backup can also operate in a bandwidth-
efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you  can use  rdiff-backup
and ssh to securely back a  hard drive up  to a remote location, and only
the  differences will be  transmitted.  

Changes: New code to list and delete older increments (useful if you are
running out of space on the target drive).

  by D. Richard Hipp (http://freshmeat.net/users/drh/)
  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 14:16

Category: Database :: Database Engines/Servers

About: SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A
large subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and flexiblity of
an SQL database without the administrative hassles of supporting a separate
database server. Because it omits the client-server interaction overhead
and writes directly to disk, SQLite is also faster than the big database
servers for most operations. In addition to the C library, the SQLite
distribution includes a command-line tool for interacting nwith SQLite
databases and SQLite bindings for Tcl/Tk.  

Changes: Minor bugfixes and support for temporary tables.

[060] - threads 3.5 (Development)
  by hansen (http://freshmeat.net/users/hanseno/)
  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 18:20

Category: Software Development :: Libraries

About: Threads is a library designed to make threading under C++ simpler.
It provides a "pthread" class, with an abstract method called "thread". It
also provides classes for mutual exclusion of parallel processes and
condition signalling, and a semaphore class that comes in handy when
synchronizing constructor and threaded method. The aim of the threads
library is to provide a simple, yet powerful means of threading
applcations, and to provide shared memory and process scoping to C++
programs.

Changes: Compilation problems with GCC 3.0 have been fixed. The I/O control
class has been preparted for types of sockets other than STREAM. Dynamic
I/O buffering has been rewritten, both for performance and to allow data
inside it to be read either as streamed data or as buffered messages. Data
is delivered only once to the receiver class, and pending requests are
queued and delivered when the receiver is available. There are minor
bugfixes.

  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 01:53

Categories: Text Editors, Utilities

About: Thumbpad is a simple note taking program, which  displays a very
large keyboard that you can easily  type on using only one finger. So, if
you're holding  your PDA with one hand, you can use your thumb.  The
default keyboard provides the 16 most  commonly used keys (in English), and
two other  layouts provide the remaining letters, numbers, and  some
punctuation. Thumbpad is an FLTK  application, originally intended for the
Agenda VR3  PDA. It is based on utilware's "dotNote" for PalmOS.

Changes: Resizing when keyboard or statusbar is popped-up, audio feedback
when you press keys, build support for SNOW-based Agenda (comes with
pre-compiled binary), correct state saving on the Agenda, bigger button
labels, and other UI changes added.

[062] - tictactoe 1.1 (Stable)
  by BluesMoon (http://freshmeat.net/users/bluesmoon/)
  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 06:58

Category: Games/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games

About: This implementation of tictactoe can have an NxN sized board, where
N is an odd number >= 3. What makes this implementation different from
others is that it does not use lookahead, and still never loses. It is more
of an experiment than anything else.

Changes: Board size can now be determined at run time. Default board size
is still specified at compile time. Only odd- or 0-sized boards are allowed
at run time.

  by Ornicar (http://freshmeat.net/users/ornicar/)
  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 15:57

Category: Office/Business :: Scheduling

About: VCalSax is a simple Python module for managing scheduler data in
XML. It enables loading data from VCalendar files into DOM trees, and to
rewrite such trees as VCalendar files.  To make such conversions, VCalSax
defines a Sax parser which changes the VCalendar format to a specific XML
format, and a XSL Transform to build VCalendar files.  VCalendar is a
standard format for scheduler data used in many calendar software
(KOrganizer, Evolution, etc.). 

Changes: SAX interface conformity.

Category: Internet :: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

About: vsftpd is an FTP server written from the ground up to be free of
security holes, whilst providing safeguards so the impact is low if it
isn't. It is also very small and fast.

Changes: Upload resuming, building without PAM, building on Solaris, and
building with older versions of gcc have all been fixed. The "install"
target has been improved. Support has been added for libcap and for NFS
mounted home directories. The download message has been improved.

  Tuesday, October 9th 2001 22:09

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP, Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: XWeb generates Web sites out of XML files by processing them with
XSLT, adding navigation information into this process and rendering images
for buttons and banners. In addition, files can be processed using command
line tools or just be copied into the target structure.   

Changes: A number of minor bugfixes, a new generic stylesheet, and a
manual.  The new generic stylesheet allows creating Web sites without
writing XSLT, and the manual explains how to use this stylesheet and other
aspects of XWeb.

[001] - 2-Disk Xwindow Linux System 1.0
  by mungkie (http://freshmeat.net/users/mungkie/)
  Thursday, October 25th 2001 14:39

Category: System :: Software Distribution

About: The 2-Disk Xwindow System is a small Linux distribution which
includes libc2.1, busybox, tinylogin, e3, pppd, several daemons, X,
alloywm, chimera, and xpaint. The kernel (2.4.6) supports umsdos, ext2,
initrd, floppy, iso9660, ppp, and networking. 

Changes: Updated and improved boot config scripts, addition of udhcp, fixes
for iptables configuration, improved chimera tables support, and new
scripts.

[002] - batemail 0.8.0
  by Ryan VanMiddlesworth (http://freshmeat.net/users/ryanvm/)
  Thursday, October 25th 2001 01:15

Category: Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: batemail is a Perl script that you slip between your MTA (e.g.
Sendmail) and your local mailer (e.g. Procmail) to strip potentially nasty
attachments from email messages. It takes input on STDIN, removes
executable MIME attachments, and gives the result to the local mailer. The
criteria for a taboo attachment are that the filename ends in one of
several "blacklisted" extensions (EXE, VBS, etc.). 

Changes: batemail now has the ability to save blocked attachments. I/O has
been improved - the output is now piped directly to the local mailer (no
more tempfile). Some new documentation has been added on setting up
outbound filtering (with Sendmail), and also on installing batemail using
Sendmail m4 macros. The default location for certain files has been
changed.

Category: Internet :: Name Service (DNS)

About: The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) implements an Internet name
server for Unix operating systems. The BIND consists of a server (or
`daemon') called `named' and a resolver library. A name server is a network
service that enables clients to name resources or objects and share this
information with other objects in the network.

Changes: This is a release candidate for BIND 9.2.0, which contains a
number of new features over BIND 9.1.  Several bugs in 9.2.0rc7 have been
fixed.

any JPG image as the background, and can create PDF files in addition to
the PostScript files created by cdlabelgen. 

Changes: Subtitle (-s) strings used to be removed from end caps even if
they fit. Now they will be printed.

About: Drip is a DVD to divx conversion frontend and backend application
set. The frontend is GNOME based, and the backend encoding engine is a
textmode only tool. Using the GUI just makes it all easier, and adds some
logic, like automatic filenaming and subpicture detection. Drip does the
whole job in 1 go - no user interaction is needed during runtime. 

Changes: This release has a completely rewritten DVD handling code,
deinterlacing, and can cope with large files - it no longer needs to mount
the DVD disk.

users. Changes made to make_debian include better checks when looking for
installed packages on the host system, easier editing, and the use of
dswim. The documentation has been slightly improved, and the most recent
user-mode-linux is included.

[027] - Linux Persistent Memory 0.1.8 (Development)
  by H. Peter Anvin (http://freshmeat.net/users/hpa/)
  Thursday, October 25th 2001 14:53

Category: Software Development :: Libraries

About: LPSM is a C library with a simple interface that manages a segment
of memory backed by a persistent file. It differs from ordinary mmap() in
two ways: it can optionally offer heap management (malloc/free/realloc)
within the arena, and more importantly, a transaction log is used to ensure
the consistency of the persistent representation. The application notifies
LPSM whenever the arena is in a consistent state, suitable for
checkpointing. If the application or system crashes, the arena will always
be recovered to a consistent checkpoint.

Changes: Offline log recovery has been added. This release will make sure
that "errno" contains useful values. The documentation has been cleaned up
some more. There is a workaround for a gcc 2.91 bug.

[033] - newsstar 0.4.3
  by Tony Houghton (http://freshmeat.net/users/realh/)
  Thursday, October 25th 2001 18:28

Category: Communications :: Usenet News

About: Newsstar fetches news and posts it to a local news server, usually
INN. What makes newsstar special is that it can make multiple simultaneous
connections, not only to one server, but to several, supporting up to 10
"threads". Before fetching each article, it checks that it hasn't already
been downloaded by another thread or in a previous session. It can also
"pipeline" article requests to make better use of available bandwidth. 

Changes: This release corrects the behaviour when using -f and -s options
together, doesn't start a new thread unless there are definitely articles
available for download, limits internal max_threads setting if the total
number possible for all servers is lower, and increases the number of
arguments allowed before a warning.

[034] - Operating-Menu 2.0 beta2
  by aotto (http://freshmeat.net/users/aotto/)
  Thursday, October 25th 2001 06:23

Categories: Desktop Environment, System :: Monitoring, Terminals,
Utilities

About: Operating-Menu is an easy-to-use and easy-to-configure ncurses-based
menu interface for the UNIX environment. It has three interesting features:
1) It is very small and focuses only on one task. 2) It creates an
impressive ncurses interface without using any external packages for TCL;
the whole interface depends on the standard UNIX command "tput". 3) It
distinguish between "Programmer" and "User" on a UNIX box; a powerful
configuration interface hides the software from the user.

Changes: A bugfix has been made in OpMenu.tcl, and a full rewite has been
made on the "tclterm" C interface. The Tcl-Obj interface is now in use.
Strong speed improvements have been made, and the documantation has been
updated. Avoid transformation of integer geometry data into string based
representation.

[040] - Reliable Forwarder Daemon 1.1.3
  by Paul Sheer (http://freshmeat.net/users/psheer/)
  Thursday, October 25th 2001 14:37

Categories: Internet, Security :: Cryptography, System :: Networking

About: The Reliable Forwarder Daemon (rfd) does TCP forwarding by listening
on a user-defined port and forwarding incoming connections transparently
through a second rfd server on a remote machine. Ultra reliable forwarding
is achieved using a zero overhead reconnect protocol. Reconnections happen
periodically if no data is read from the remote machine due to errors.
Reconnections are transparent to the service being forwarded. This is
useful for POP/IMAP connections, which will survive a modem failure. The
server can handle an arbitrary large number of connections, but no forking
or threading is ever done. rfd handles multiple simultaneous connections
efficiently without blocking.

Changes: A major rework of the underlying library (compression and
encryption were added), thorough testing, and lots of behavioral fixes.

  by Oskar Liljeblad (http://freshmeat.net/users/osk/)
  Thursday, October 25th 2001 10:37

Categories: System, System :: Archiving

About: The file renaming utilities (renameutils for short) are a set of
programs designed to make renaming of multiple files faster and less
cumbersome. It currently consists of two programs: "qmv" and "imv".  qmv
allows files to be renamed by editing their names in any text editor. Since
the files are listed after each other, this allows common changes to be
made more quickly.  imv ("interactive mv") is trivial but useful when you
are too lazy to type (or even complete) the name of the file to rename. It
allows the filename to be edited in the terminal using the GNU readline
library. This is also useful when renaming files in Midnight Commander,
where the whole filename has to be entered again. 

Changes: Manual pages were added. A Debian package was created.

Categories: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio, Multimedia :: Sound/Audio ::
Conversion, Multimedia :: Video, Multimedia :: Video :: Conversion

About: transcode is a text console video-stream processing tool. It
supports elementary video and audio frame transformations. Some example
modules are included to enable import of MPEG program streams (VOB),
Digital Video (DV), or YUV video (YV12) and export modules for writing
DivX, OpenDivX, or uncompressed AVI files. A set of tools is available to
extract and decode the sources into raw video/audio streams for import and
to enable post-processing of AVI files.  

Changes: This last pre-release has improved audio/video synchronization for
program streams. Experimental support for automatic 3:2 pull-down
detection, and inverse tele-cine for NTSC format is available. Hopefully,
the deadlock bug with option "-M 2" is fixed. Video frame processing is now
managed by a thread pool. A new import module for the Nuppelvideo file
format is included, changes in the frame region selection logic have been
made, and a bug in the DVD chapter mode was fixed.

Categories: Education, Games/Entertainment, Multimedia :: Sound/Audio,
Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Capture/Recording, Multimedia :: Sound/Audio
:: Speech, Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: VoiceApp records sound from soundcard (or any file) and converts it
to frequency domain via FFT, showing the result in a window. This effect is
also known as VoicePrint or sound power spectrum. VA is ideal for playing
with a microphone or as a eye-candy when left on in the background. It can
also display the frequency you point at.

Changes: Automake/autoconf is now used for building. A scope display and
analyzer were added. The source was made ready for use as an XMMS-plugin.
The data is now displayed in units of dB. A memory manager was added to
move the "FFT-window" across input data. A "-sleep" switch was added,
allowing you to slow VoiceApp down when getting input from STDIN.

Section: Editorials
Saturday, November 3rd 2001 00:00

I have been a network administrator for about five years.  It has been said
that administration is hours of boredom interrupted by moments of sheer
panic. Through the highs and lows of this existence, there is one constant:
answering user requests.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers Software Development :: Libraries ::
Application Frameworks

About: Bitmovers Maui is a Java-based technology for developing user
interfaces for server-side applications that deploy dynamically to a
variety of network-enabled platforms. Maui's intuitive API makes building
interfaces simple -- no need for templates, and no need to know the many
nuances of each markup language. It has a fully  object-oriented and
event-based environment, automatic image generation, and a rich set of
components. The Maui server is 100% Java. It handles the client- specific
output for you, currently supporting Web, WAP, and Wireless Palm devices.
Secure Sockets over HTTP are supported, and it has a need-based caching
system. 

Changes: Some fixes to the WAP side of Maui for some ClassCastExceptions
which were occuring when accessing Maui through a WAP browser, and
optimized rendering of MRadioButtons on Palm/WCA devices.

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Common C++ is a highly portable C++ class library meant primarily
for the development of portable threaded applications. A separate source
tree is maintained for both pthread "POSIX" targets (Linux, xBSD, Solaris,
etc), and for Win32 targets. The goal is to provide a truly common C++
framework for writing portable threaded applications that do not require a
huge amount of runtime overhead to support, and hence can make C++ and
threads suitable even for the development of trivial servers and
applications.

Changes: A new std::exception-based exception handling model and namespace
support, use of a single unified source tree for Win32/POSIX development,
and addition of a Common C++ Template library.

inherit their successful  behavior encoded in their genotype. To run it,
Java 1.3 must be installed. 

Changes: The evolution has been partly restarted with new but compatible
chess-playing individuals, characterized by a more sophisticated and
experimental behavior in search. It is possible to replace, initialize,
mutate, and recombine individuals manually. Individuals can also be loaded
from a file into the population, weak playing individuals will be
identified and replaced quickly, and good ones will skip the first games.

Database

About: OpenDRDA is an open source implementation of the DRDA (Distributed
Relational Database Architecture) protocol developed by IBM and endorsed as
an OpenGroup standard for client to database server communication. The

server-side support to all major open source databases.  

Changes: OpenDRDA is now capable of querying a DB2 (or other DRDA) data
source and returning results. The authors still need developers, especially
those with access to test against DB2 on OS/400 and MVS platforms.
Interested developers without access to a DRDA server can contact the list.

[035] - Openwall Linux kernel patch 2.2.20-ow1
  by Solar Designer (http://freshmeat.net/users/solardiz/)
  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 03:01

Security System :: Operating System Kernels :: Linux System :: Systems
Administration

About: The Openwall Linux kernel patch is a collection of security
"hardening" features for the Linux kernel. In addition to the new features,
some versions of the patch contain various security fixes. The "hardening"
features of the patch, while not a complete method of protection, provide
an extra layer of security against the easier ways to exploit certain
classes of vulnerabilities and/or reduce the impact of those
vulnerabilities. The patch can also add a little bit more privacy to the
system by restricting access to parts of /proc so that users may not see
what others are doing.

Changes: We have updated to Linux 2.2.20, which adds a workaround for a
vulnerability with certain packet filter setups, and SYN cookies where the
packet filter rules could be bypassed. Additionally, even more of the
support for combined ELF/a.out setups has been moved under a separate
configuration option.

[045] - Stepper motor control 0.1.1 (Alpha)
  by Enrico Gueli (http://freshmeat.net/users/EnricoGu/)
  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 14:11

System :: Hardware

About: Stepper motor control is a little utility that allows you to drive
up to two 4-phase unipolar stepper motors connected to the parallel port.
It can do absolute (to a certain angular position) or relative (clockwise
or counter- clockwise by a certain angle) movement at every speed. Angles
may be measured in steps, degrees or revolutions.

Changes: Some things have been added to the README, and it has been
translated into English (however, it is not fully completed).

[046] - Stunnel 3.21b
  by Michal Trojnara (http://freshmeat.net/users/mtrojnar/)
  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 13:00

Security :: Cryptography

About: The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL encryption wrapper
between remote client and local (inetd-startable) or remote server. It can
be used to add SSL functionality to commonly used inetd daemons like POP2,
POP3, and IMAP servers without any changes in the programs' code. It will
negotiate an SSL connection using the OpenSSL or SSLeay libraries. It calls
the underlying crypto libraries, so stunnel supports whatever cryptographic
algorithms you compiled into your crypto package.

Changes: A file descriptor leak on failed connect() has been fixed.

[047] - SUBMIT 1.2
  by Ian Haywood (http://freshmeat.net/users/ihaywood/)
  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 12:48

Education Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Software Development

About: SUBMIT is a Web-based system for university computer science
departments which allows the submission and assessment of students'
programming assignments. Programs are validated, compiled, and executed on
the central server. Results of execution are available to students and
markers. Markers can write comments which are available to the students.
Detailed statistics of each project are available to the lecturer. Students
can submit as individuals or as a group. C, C++, Python, and Java are
supported.  . There is a tight security model for Java: the security
features of the language prevent student assignments from using the
filesystem or network while running on the server. The server cannot be
(easily) crashed by the student programs. 

Changes: Support for languages other than Java has been added (but not
fully tested).

[051] - TwoFTPd 1.14 (Stable)
  by Bruce Guenter (http://freshmeat.net/users/bruceguenter/)
  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 17:20

Internet :: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

About: Twoftpd is an FTP server that strives to be secure, simple, and
efficient. None of the commands can cause execution of other programs, and
the normal model of execution does a chroot to the logged in user's
directory immediately after authentication. The name "twoftpd" comes from
the fact that there are two parts to the server: an authenticating front
end, which contains no file or data transfer code, and one of two back
ends, which contain all the data transfer code. 

Changes: A fix for a bug in the string sort implementation that caused
listings to leak memory, a fix for PASV connection mode to only show the
150 response if the connection does not fail, a workaround for broken
firewalls that rewrite certain commands (specifically PORT) with two CR
characters before the final LF, strip trailing slashes from the home path,
use of corked (Linux) or no-push (BSD) socket mode to improve transfer
efficiency, and some other minor fixes to socket handling and response
messages.

layer and a set of applications to allow Linux systems to participate in a
DECnet phase IV network. It currently has an application library (suitable
for building DECnet functionality into X11R6), file and terminal access.

Changes: This release is just a minor update. The tools now use the
expected username for proxies when run under "su" or "sudo". A stupid
"error: success" message has been fixed. A couple of portability issues
have been addressed for those building on more obscure platforms.

Text Editors

About: e3 is a full-screen, user-friendly text editor with an interface
similar to that of either WordStar, Emacs, Pico, Nedit, or vi. It's heavily
optimized for size and independent of libc or any other libraries, making
it useful for mini-Linux distributions and rescue disks. The assembler
version also supports FreeBSD, Win9x, QNX and BeOS. There is also a
separately distributed version written in C which supports some other Unix
versions and CygWin. It is also possible to use regular expressions by
using child processes like sed. e3 has a built in arithmetic calculator.

Changes: Support was added for the QNX Realtime Platform OS.

[010] - EchoWall Firewall 1.33
  by sbest (http://freshmeat.net/users/sbest/)
  Sunday, November 11th 2001 03:13

Security System :: Networking System :: Networking :: Firewalls

About: EchoWall is a firewall configuration package for creating an
ipchains-based Linux firewall. It is optimized for the Linux Router Project
(LRP), but was originally created for a Debian platform. EchoWall's aim is
simplicity for entry-level users. It presumes the user is using a Linux box
as a masquerading firewall/router for a single Class-C address range. It
manages services in an interesting way: instead of indicating the IP
addresses of machines you want to act as servers, you instead specify them
by their MAC address.  When run, the echowall script automatically detects
the current IP address associated with this MAC address. This allows you to
connect a service to a machine whose IP address is dynamically assigned. 

Changes: Scripts were modified to support both Eigerstein2Beta and
Dachstein releases of LEAF. "scan" mode was fixed to report only devices on
the LAN. Quake, HLife, and SMB sections were fixed.  Support for SNMP and
Gnutella was added.

[011] - Emacs/LaTeX inline Preview 0.5.8.2
  by David Kastrup (http://freshmeat.net/users/dakas/)
  Sunday, November 11th 2001 13:26

Text Editors :: Emacs Text Processing :: Markup :: LaTeX

About: The purpose of the Emacs/LaTeX inline Preview package is to embed
LaTeX environments such as display math or figures into the Emacs source
buffers. By mouse-clicking, you can open the original text. After editing,
another click will just run the region in question through LaTeX and
redisplay the new results. It requires version 21.1 or higher of Emacs and
AucTeX. XEmacs support is not yet usable. 

Changes: The focus of this release was mostly on user interface
improvements. Notable changes were made in the build process, in cursor
display handling, and in preservation of indentation of previews.
Improvements were made in process handling and configurability.

[015] - Flash 0.9.5
  by Albert White (http://freshmeat.net/users/cadelor/)
  Sunday, November 11th 2001 07:24

System :: Shells

About: Flash is an attempt to address the security problems associated with
giving local unix users full shell access. It is a (hopefully) secure shell
which will only execute administrator defined programs, while also being
very user friendly. Flash is fully windowed (using an ncurses interface),
is driven by cursor keys, has hotkey support, has fascist logging support
and more.

Changes: The unsetenv() function was renamed to flash_unsetenv() to prevent
a name clash with a standard library function. A "-L rules file" option was
added which forces users to agree to the contents of the rules file before
being allowed to use the shell. This is tracked by the presence of
~/.iagree, and agreement is logged to syslog. The lines in Makefile.in that
Solais make were having problems with were removed.

About: Newsstar fetches news and posts it to a local news server, usually

connections, not only to one server, but to several, supporting up to 10
"threads". Before fetching each article, it checks that it hasn't already
been downloaded by another thread or in a previous session. It can also
"pipeline" article requests to make better use of available bandwidth. 

Changes: An error in the statement opening the gdbm history database has
been fixed. This release also has a new "batch" post_method. This is not
implemented in the front-end script, because INN doesn't really support
being fed articles this way; it's designed for future compatibility.

check. 

Changes: More files are now checked. Code was rewritten to make the program
much smaller.

individual files from the archive. It includes a FIFO for speed, a pattern
matcher, multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse files,
automatic archive format detection, automatic byte order recognition,
automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives, and special
features that allow star to be used for full backups. It includes the only
known platform independant "rmt" server program that hides Linux
incompatibilities. The "rmt" server from the star package implements all
Sun/GNU/Schily/BSD enhancements and allows any "rmt" client from any OS to
contact any OS as server.

test for rcmd() to compile on platforms without remote support.  A bug with
ACLs where star tried to get a non-existing ACL for symlinks has been
fixed. There is a README.ACL file for hints on the new ACL support.

[059] - Stealth Kernel Patch 2.2.20
  by Robert Salizar (http://freshmeat.net/users/madcamel1/)
  Sunday, November 11th 2001 15:59

About: Stealth IP Stack is a kernel patch for Linux 2.2 which makes your
machine almost invisible on the network without impeding normal network
operation. Many denial of service attacks (such as stream) are much less
effective with this patch installed, and port scanners slow to a crawl. It
works by restricting TCP RST packets (no "Connection Refused"), restricting
ICMP_UNREACH on UDP (prevents UDP portscans), and restricting all ICMP and
IGMP requests. A sysctl interface is used so these features can be turned
on and off on the fly.

Changes: Updated for kernel 2.2.20.

About: The stunnel program is designed to work as an SSL encryption wrapper
between remote client and local (inetd-startable) or remote server. It can
be used to add SSL functionality to commonly used inetd daemons like POP2,
POP3, and IMAP servers without any changes in the programs' code. It will
negotiate an SSL connection using the OpenSSL or SSLeay libraries. It calls
the underlying crypto libraries, so stunnel supports whatever cryptographic
algorithms you compiled into your crypto package.

Changes: The autoconf scripts have been upgraded to work with version 2.52.
A problem with pthread_sigmask on Darwin has been fixed. Some documentation
typos have been corrected. This release will attempt to ignore EINTR in
transfer(). The shared library version is reported on startup. There are
DLLs for OpenSSL 0.9.6b.

About: XML Usecases allows management of UML usecases as XML documents.
Subdirectories are used to categorise the usecases. Tomcat (or some other
serlvet container) is used to combine the individual usecases into the full
document. XSLT is used to provide specialized views of the full document. A
Java applet is used to provide a tree view of the document.  A Web browser
that understands XML + CSS is used to display the full document or some
subset of the usecases, including categories and/or multiple selections in
the tree.

[072] - xpad 0.2.3 (Development)
  by Michael Terry (http://freshmeat.net/users/mikix/)
  Sunday, November 11th 2001 03:05

Desktop Environment Utilities

About: xpad is a paperless substitute for leaving notes on index cards, or
"post-it" notes all over your desk. It opens small text boxes on the X
display so that notes can be written and then left to be read later.

Changes: The previously broken autosaving support now works and is more
fault-tolerant (xpad will no longer lose your notes on a quick X shutdown).
xpad now remembers the default sizes of pads. Minor bugfixes and cleanups
added.

  Friday, November 23rd 2001 19:51

Internet :: Log Analysis Security System :: Logging

About: fwanalog is a shell script that parses and summarizes firewall
logfiles. It understands logs from BSD ipf, Linux 2.2 ipchains and 2.4
iptables. It uses the excellent log analysis program Analog (also free
software) to create its reports. It does so by converting the firewall log
into a fake web server log and calling Analog with a modified
configuration.

Changes: Bugfixes for dropped ICMP packets in ipchains and iptables (Linux
2.2 and 2.4).

  by Thomas Nemeth (http://freshmeat.net/users/tnemeth/)
  Friday, November 23rd 2001 13:02

Text Processing :: Markup :: LaTeX

About: glatex is a small program designed to help you to edit your LaTeX
document files (sources, styles, bibliography, figures, postscript images,
etc.). It maintains a list of all your editable files in order to allow you
to edit them quickly. But you can also launch the compilator, viewer, and
print commands, and it allows you to have document templates for creating
new projects. It is not intended to manage the files themselves. For
example, if you move a file from one directory to another, you'll have to
remove it from the list and re-add it from its new location.

Changes: Fixes for document creation from templates, saving in advanced
features, and a bug in loading config, more templates, a new ability to
print page by page for big documents, an ability to display only sources
(by default) or all files, splitting the preferences window into
preferences and advanced features windows, putting default templates in
INSTALLDIR/share/glatex/templates/, and more.

an optional logo, and language/session type selection support. The daemon
includes an XDMCP implementation for managing remote displays. Access
control relies on TCPWrappers and PAM.

Changes: Multiple local displays, some leaks, and a crash with timed login
have been fixed. Support has been added for no input windows on the login
screen.

Scientific/Engineering

About: GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was inspired by
both TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured documents
via a "wysiwyg" and user friendly interface. The program implements high
quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts. It is also possible to use
TeXmacs as an interface to computer algebra systems. Finally, TeXmacs
supports the Guile/Scheme extension language, which makes it possible to
adapt the user interface to specific needs, and even to extend the editor.

Changes: This version implements inclusion of documents into other
documents. The support of projects and multi-file documents uses this
feature. New tools are now provided for writing and maintaining
dictionaries for foreign language support. Finally, support for
Portuguese/Brazilian has been added.

[026] - grep 2.5f (Alpha)
  by bero (http://freshmeat.net/users/bero/)
  Friday, November 23rd 2001 11:17

About: GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to look at
every character. The result is typically many times faster than Unix grep
or egrep.

Changes: This release adds -o (--only-matching) and -D (--devices), changes
the --color option to support ls-like --color=tty options, fixes building
with autoconf 2.5x/automake 1.5, and adds various bugfixes and
optimizations.  This is a release candidate for grep 2.5.

About: Procwatch is security monitor written in Perl that watches a /proc
filesystem for new processes. When a process is created, procwatch reports
the time, the username, the PID, and the binary that was run. Its output is
suitable for logging to log files and is geared for system administrators
who are testing a new but as yet untrusted UNIX system. Although it cannot
detect, and is not proof against, hacked loadable kernel modules that have
modified /proc, it is useful in watching for possible rogue binaries.

[054] - SQLite 2.1.3
  by D. Richard Hipp (http://freshmeat.net/users/drh/)
  Friday, November 23rd 2001 22:07

Database :: Database Engines/Servers

About: SQLite is a C library that implements an SQL database engine. A
large subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and flexiblity of
an SQL database without the administrative hassles of supporting a separate
database server. Because it omits the client-server interaction overhead
and writes directly to disk, SQLite is also faster than the big database
servers for most operations. In addition to the C library, the SQLite
distribution includes a command-line tool for interacting nwith SQLite
databases and SQLite bindings for Tcl/Tk.  

Changes: A fix for a bug in the DROP TABLE command which could (very
rarely) leave the database in an unreadable state, fixes for other less
serious bugs, and a FAQ in the documentation set.

  Thursday, December 6th 2001 12:20

Education Multimedia :: Graphics Multimedia :: Graphics :: Presentation

About: aiSee reads a textual, easy-to-read and easy-to-learn graph
specification and automatically calculates a customizable graph layout.
This layout is then displayed, and can be printed or interactively
explored. aiSee features 15 basic graph layout algorithms (including
force-directed layout), recursive subgraph nesting, fish-eye views, and an
animation interface. It has been optimized to handle huge graphs
automatically generated by applications (e.g. compilers). It is available
for Linux, Solaris, NetBSD, SunOS, and Windows.

Changes: This release includes file operation enhancements; for instance,
File->Save now supports saving subgraph coordinates. The exporting of
graphs to (encapsulated) PostScript was enhanced. Furthermore, a filter
function has been implemented in node the title dialog boxp, and a better
algorithm for double-focus fish-eye views has been implemented. The latter
is an experimental feature. Some minor bugs have been remedied.

[008] - CdBase perl/Tk 0.2.6 (stable)
  by Dany Vanderroost (http://freshmeat.net/users/danyv/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 16:33

Database :: Front-Ends

About: CdBase greps the cdlabel and contents of a CD and places them in a
PgSQL database. The database has one generic table (cdlabel, file) and one
table per CD (path, file, readme, install). English is the default
language, but other languages are supported (de, es, fr, it & nl). The
search function takes its result from the generic table and opens a new
window to show the appropriate file(s) from each CD table. CdBase is
written in Perl/Tk and works fine on a P100.

Changes: This release adds German and Dutch translations. A bug where the
count procedure didn't refresh has been fixed, and a Spanish translation is
in progress.

Communications :: File Sharing System :: Archiving

About: cfv is a utility to both test and create .sfv (Simple File Verify),
.csv, md5sum, and bsd md5 files. These files are commonly used to ensure
the correct retrieval or storage of data.

Changes: A fix for a file.close() exception on -C in empty dir, mmap
support for faster checksumming when not using fchksum module, handling
files made by programs that add quotes to filenames, print stats about
number of case differences and quoted filenames, display seperate stats per
checksum file, a fix for excessive memory usage on deep recursive create
mode in tree with lots of files, throwing an exception for an unaccessible
dir in recursive mode, and an already existing checksum file causes a
cferror rather than an immediate exit in create mode.

  Thursday, December 6th 2001 17:40

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries Software
Development Software Development :: Quality Assurance

About: Codestriker is a Perl CGI script that is used for performing code
reviews in a collaborative fashion, as opposed to using unstructured
emails. Authors create code review topics, the nominated reviewers being
automatically notified by email. Reviewers then submit comments against the
code on a per-line basis, and can view comments submitted by the other
reviewers as they are created. Emails are sent to the appropriate parties,
as an alert mechanism, when comments are created. The author is free to
submit comments against the review comments. Once all reviewers have
finished the author has all review comments available in a structured
fashion, instead of a pile of unstructured emails.  

Changes: Code review comments for specific line numbers can be seen on the
main view page by moving your mouse over the line number. If Microsoft IE
is used, a tooltip will appear with the comments. The status line is also
used for this purpose, to avoid the necessity of going to the edit page to
view the comments that have already been made.

[011] - Cyrus IMAP server 2.1.0
  by Larry Greenfield (http://freshmeat.net/users/larrygreenfield/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 14:12

Communications :: Email :: Post-Office :: IMAP Internet

About: The Cyrus IMAP is generally intended to be run on sealed servers,
where normal users are not permitted to log in. The mailbox database is
stored in parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP
system. All user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP
protocols. The private mailbox database design gives the server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The
server supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on
mailbox hierarchies, multiple SASL mechanisms, and the Sieve mail filtering
language.

Changes: This release uses the Cyrus SASL 2.0 library, allows for an
alternative namespace and hierarchy separator that may work better with
some clients, and can support full-text mailbox indexing. There are many
other minor changes.

About: FNR or "Free Network Registrar" is based on an idea implemented on
CAR (Cisco Access Registrar) by Cisco Systems, which lets you run your own
DHCP/BOOTP/DNS server.  The interesting aspect of it is its modules
support, based on shared libraries (c code) or scripts (tcl/tk).  FNR is
basically a generic server; you can run whatever you want to.  You can code
a mini-dhcp or mini-telnet or mini-whatever server.  Each extension can
access two different environments, both handled and loaded at startup time
(like daemontools) with "envdir".  This environment lets you read/write
variables and log to files.

where the debugger is running and provides friendly support for
cross-debuggers (VxWorks, Lynx, etc.). For instance, you can use Linux or
Windows to debug an application running on a Power PC board with a debugger
running on a Sun workstation.

Changes: This release features general stabilization and improvements in
error/warning messages, better handling of VxWorks targets, and friendler
handling of Yes/No type of dialogs. The main source file is now shown in
the explorer when it opens. The fields in the "New Debugger" dialog are now
filled with parameters from the command line. A message dialog now pops up
when trying to detach a process while the underlying debugger is busy. The
column sizes and visibility for the stack window are now remembered from
one session to another. The explorer now displays the return type for
functions. Several bugfixes were made.

Other/Nonlisted Topic Software Development :: Libraries

About: ICU provides a Unicode implementation, with functions for formatting
numbers, dates, times, and currencies (according to locale conventions,
transliteration, and parsing text in those formats). It provides flexible
patterns for formatting messages, where the pattern determines the order of
the variable parts of the messages, and the format for each of those
variables. These patterns can be stored in resource files for translation
to different languages. Included are more than 100 codepage converters for
interaction with non-unicode systems.

Changes: All of ICU supports the full Unicode 3.1.1 range, which includes
supplementary characters. It's easier to use more than one version of ICU
at the same time. Transliteration has many more features. The Unicode
normalization algorithm has been sped up. A new string search API has been
added. Various collation improvements have been added.

Software Development :: Compilers Software Development :: Libraries Text
Processing :: Filters

About: Libtre is an attempt to create a lightweight, robust, and efficient
POSIX compliant regexp matching library. There is still some work left, 
but the results so far are promising.  At its core is a new algorithm for
regular expression matching with submatch addressing. The algorithm uses
linear worst-case time in the length of the text being searched, and
quadratic worst-case time in the length of the used regular expression. In
other words, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(MN), where M is the
length of the regular expression and N is the length of the text. The used
space is also quadratic on the length of the regex, but does not depend on
the searched string.

[055] - Smarty PHP template engine 1.5.0
  by Monte Ohrt (http://freshmeat.net/users/mohrt/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 18:01

Software Development

About: Smarty is a template engine for PHP. Many other template engines for
PHP provide basic variable substitution and dynamic block functionality.
Smarty takes a step further to be a "smart" template engine, adding
features such as configuration files, template functions, and variable
modifiers, and making all of this functionality as easy as possible to use
for both programmers and template designers. Smarty also converts the
templates into PHP scripts, eliminating the need to parse the templates on
every invocation. This makes Smarty extremely scalable and managable for
large application needs.

Changes: Several feature enhancements were made to this version, most
notably the {foreach ...} command, which is an alternative to {section ...}
with an easier syntax for looping through a single array of values. Several
functions were enhanced so that the output can be automatically assigned to
a template variable instead of displayed (assign attribute). Cache files
can now be controlled with a custom function as an alternative to the
built-in file based method. Many code cleanups and bugfixes went into this
release as well.

About: StarPlot is a GTK-based program, written in C++, which can be used
interactively to view three-dimensional perspective charts of stars. Charts
can be recentered, rotated, or zoomed in or out with a mouse click (this
can also, of course, be done via dialog boxes for more precision). Stars
may be viewed (or ignored) by spectral class and absolute magnitude. Other
features include support for both celestial and galactic coordinate
systems, the ability to display extended non-stellar objects, and a pop-up
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.  StarPlot is also packaged with starconvert, a
utility which converts line-oriented stellar data records to StarPlot
format. Most star data files available on the Internet can be converted
this way if a short file describing the original file format is provided to
starconvert. 

Changes: The program legend is now clickable, providing a shortcut to the
spectral class part of the Chart->Star Filter dialog box. Full
constellation names are now displayed and can be searched on.

[064] - WeSQL 0.50
  by Ward Vandewege (http://freshmeat.net/users/wardv/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 12:08

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: The Web-enabled SQL (WeSQL) library is an extension to HTML, acting
as a glue between HTML and SQL. It allows the use of pure SQL queries
directly in HTML files, embedded in a special tag, among many other
features. It translates the special tags into pure HTML, so using it is
transparent for the browser. It is aimed at rapid web-database integration,
and written in Perl. Because it runs under mod_perl, it is fast. It
currently supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL as backend SQL databases. 

Changes: This version is a complete rewrite, with many enhancements. In
particular, the code is now a standard Perl module (installable with the
usual 'perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && su && make install'), and

[067] - xrmap 2.01 (Stable)
  by Jean-Pierre Demailly (http://freshmeat.net/users/demailly/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 05:31

Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: Xrmap is a program running under X that can interactively display
portions of the Earth, using the huge CIA world vector map. It is based on
an earlier console utility 'rmap'. It features political boundaries, major
and minor rivers, glaciers, lakes, canals, etc. The map remains accurate
under a very large zoom factor, which can possibly exceed 100. Spherical,
rectangular, Mercator and Miller projections are implemented, and all
features can be interactively set from the GUI. 

Changes: Some minor bugfixes have been made, e.g. for the use of wild cards
in the search routine. The default color scheme has been improved, and
there is a new option controlling the order in which features are drawn
(and may overlap).

[001] - 4P 0.09
  by Jerronimo (http://freshmeat.net/users/jerronimo/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 19:56

About: 4P is a pixel-based image editor. Its strength lies in editing
palette-based images rather than true-color images.

Changes: More of the GUI has been implemented (modal dialogs, bitmap
buttons, listview, and file requestor), and palettes load along with images
being loaded.

  by Damon B. Poole (http://freshmeat.net/users/damonpoole/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 17:01

Software Development Software Development :: Bug Tracking Software
Development :: Quality Assurance

About: AccuRev/CM is a fast, powerful, and easy-to-use "Timesafe" SCM tool
which is based on the idea that the past can't change. AccuRev/CM records
all merges, so you never have to re-merge the same code. It includes an

follows a client/server model, and is transaction-based. Servers and
clients run on Unix, Linux, NT, and Windows. There are both command line
and GUI interfaces for all platforms. It includes the graphical 3-way diff
and merge tool, TkDiff. AccuRev/CM also integrates with the MS SCC API and
any diff/merge tool with a command line interface.

Changes: This release includes fully customizeable bug tracking in the same
GUI and database, file locking, a completely rewritten GUI in Java, a

[004] - Active Spam Killer 1.1
  by Marco Paganini (http://freshmeat.net/users/paganini/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 01:49

Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: Active Spam Killer (ASK) protects your email account against spam by
confirming the sender's email address before actual delivery takes place.
The confirmation happens by means of a "confirmation message" that is
automatically sent to all "unknown" users. Once the sender replies to that
message (a simple reply will do), future emails from that person will be
delivered immediately. You can also specify (regexp) addresses to be
immediately accepted, rejected (with a nastygram) or ignored. The package
also includes a utility to scan your old mailboxes and generate a list of
emails to be accepted automatically.

Changes: ASK will now refuse to send confirmation messages to
mailing-lists, even if you forget to include the list address in your
whitelist.  All three lists now have extended matching capabilities.  You
can now match a message by the From/To/Subject fields (useful for mailing
lists that put the mailing-list address in the To: field).  Support for
people with more than one email address was added.  Messages coming from
the user "postmaster" are now properly recognized as MTA-generated
messages.

[005] - autonuts 1.0 (Development)
  by cider (http://freshmeat.net/users/cider/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 01:57

Internet Multimedia :: Sound/Audio

About: autonuts is a Perl script to automate downloading of songs by a
specific band or group. The script spawns gnutella using gnut and
expect.pm, searches for the band, looks for results, searches again if
insufficient results were found, processes the list to find uniques, runs
through the list of unique files to grab, queues them all, and finally
dumps you into the program itself after all the get requests have been
shouted off.

[006] - bash programmable completion 20011217
  by Ian Macdonald (http://freshmeat.net/users/ianmacd/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 01:51

System :: Shells Utilities

About: Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and
extend its standard completion behaviour to achieve complex command lines
with just a few keystrokes.  Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to
complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3
str[Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX
manual.  mount system:[Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems
from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all targets
in Makefile.  This project was conceived to produce programmable completion
routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of
typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis.

Changes: nslookup and ant completion added. ee and xv now complete on more
file types.

  by kurzawa (http://freshmeat.net/users/kurzawa/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 14:13

Database :: Front-Ends

About: Bookbase stores each of your books in a MySQL database by its unique
ISBN. Searches on your collection retrieve books by title, author,
publication / copyright date, publisher, cover type and price, or even when
or how many times you've read the book. Any entry can be modified or
deleted with ease. Report printing is in the works.

Changes: Use of GNU automake/autoconf, providing a painless compile and
install process instead of the hacked up Makefiles of previous releases.

  by Sangwan Kim (http://freshmeat.net/users/yirin/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 04:07

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Indexing/Search

About: Bookmark4U provides you a comfortable   bookmarking environment.
With Bookmark4U, users   can access to their favorite Web sites everywhere 
just by one click without remembering URLs of them  any more. The bookmark
data are stored in a   database in the server, and can be searched very  
easily. Bookmarks can be arranged in folders in any   depth. For each
bookmark, visit information is   managed, such as the visit counter, or the
last  visit time and date, etc. It is written in PHP script  language, and
requires a database interface such  as MySQL.  

Changes: Search history and a history layer, a list of visited folders,
clipboard and trash features, support for Microsoft Internet Explorer
search tabs, the ability to change special bookmarks to Quickmarks and
detect the document title, and two basic themes were added.

[009] - build 0.31
  by god_of_pain (http://freshmeat.net/users/godofpain/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 14:13

About: build simplifies C and C++ development on Linux systems. It will
scan your source code files for the required elements (libs and includes)
to create a Makefile script, and will automatically generate it. It can
also produce C++ files from Qt designer UI files as needed.

Changes: This release changes SelectiveReplace to a Perl script for better
portability. The generation of a project from templates now creates a
README.txt with the first comments. The dependancy on SiliconTaoLibs has
been removed.

[011] - Darkbot 6f6-r6
  by LuizCB (http://freshmeat.net/users/LuizCB/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 20:47

About: Darkbot, The IRC Talking Robot, is a very fast and small program
which connects to IRC and automatically "talks" and responds to users'
questions. Originally created by Jason Hamilton as an aid for help channels
to answer repeated questions from its virtually unlimited database, it has
became a very popular talking robot in a generic sense, being used all over
IRC networks for different purposes and in 17 languages. Data can be added
to it and managed dynamically online or edited in its database files
offline. An extensive but easy-to-understand list of commands and features,
including some channel operation functions and levels of protection, makes
Darkbot a very flexible but somehow powerful and complex robot, with almost
human conversations and reactions.

Changes: A bug that was causing compilation problems (error code 127 and/or
some warnings) on (at least) FreeBSD has been fixed. The code has been
improved and patched with a change which makes Darkbot not return its own
nickname when the variable R~ is used on topic/replies.

[012] - DataBind 0.4
  by Anthony Eden (http://freshmeat.net/users/anthonyeden/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 13:46

Software Development :: Libraries

About: DataBind is a library to simplify the persistance of  Java objects
to a datastore. A data store may be a  relational database, XML files, or
any other type of  datastore. Java objects which are persisted do not  need
to be modified in any way. The only  requirement for persisted objects is
that they have  read and write methods for each field that you  would like
to persist and an empty constructor. The  read and write methods are
specified at  deployment time in an XML file and thus can be any  method
(in other words they do not have to be  getter and setter methods, although
this is the  preferred method signature.)  DataBind also supports loading
and storing  collections of objects. Objects can be retrieved  from the
database using search elements to select  a subset of the available
objects.

Changes: A new readConfiguration(Reader reader) method in BinderManager
(all other readConfiguration methods call this one), a new
readConfiguration(String filename) convenience method to BinderManager, new
documentation about SearchElements, removal of writeConfiguration() and
write() methods from Binder, removal of all write() methods from Binder
implementations, use of EdenLib classes wherever possible, an upgrade to
EdenLib 1.0b1, and all new JavaDoc documentation.

  by jimm (http://freshmeat.net/users/jimm/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 01:52

Database :: Front-Ends Office/Business Software Development

About: DataVision is a database reporting tool similar to Crystal Reports,
written in Java. Multiple database backends (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle,
ODBC) and frontends (LaTeX, XML, comma- and tab-separated data files,
DocBook, and HTML) are supported. DataVision uses XML files to describe
reports. Reports can both load and save XML report files. 

Changes: DataVision has been rewritten in Java. A new GUI has been created
for report writing and running. Extensive documentation is now available.

[014] - Dynamic Probes 3.3.0
  by IBM Linux Technology Center (http://freshmeat.net/users/ibmltc/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 13:37

Software Development :: Debuggers Software Development :: Quality Assurance
Software Development :: Testing

About: Dynamic Probes (Dprobes) is a generic and pervasive system debugging
facility that will operate under the most extreme software conditions such
as debugging a deep-rooted operating system problem in a live environment.
Dprobes allows the insertion of fully automated breakpoints or probepoints
anywhere in the system and user space. Each probepoint has an associated
set of probe instructions that are interpreted when the probe fires. These
instructions allow memory and CPU registers to be examined and altered
using conditional logic. When the probe command terminates, prior to
returning to the probed code, a syslog record may be optionally generated.

Changes: A fix for the problem in trying to compile kernel with -g option,
reinstating the check for root (euid==0) in dprobes ioctl, a fix for the
oops under SMP when dprobes module is being removed, a fixed interface to
crash dump (works only with version >= 4.0), updating the minimum required
versions of LTT and crash dump in README, and upgrading to kernel version
to 2.4.16.

[015] - e3 2.0
  by kleine (http://freshmeat.net/users/kleine/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 14:13

Text Editors

About: e3 is a full-screen, user-friendly text editor with an interface
similar to that of either WordStar, Emacs, Pico, Nedit, or vi. It's heavily
optimized for size and independent of libc or any other libraries, making
it useful for mini-Linux distributions and rescue disks. The assembler
version supports Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Win9x, QNX, and BeOS.
There is also a separately distributed version written in C which supports
some other Unix versions and CygWin. It is also possible to use regular
expressions by using child processes like sed. e3 has a built in arithmetic
calculator. 

Changes: Improvements to e3's vi emulation mode and the Win9x version of
e3.

XMLRPC. There will be a client GUI Framework API to combine the use of all
these services under one easy-to-access API, so that you can write the GUI
client with much less effort.

Changes: Some enhancements and bugfixes were added to Gnutella. Gnutella
can now bind to a specific Interface IP. Some synchronization issues
relating to Gnutella Statistics were addressed.

[017] - Firewall Tester 0.4 (Development)
  by Andrea Barisani (http://freshmeat.net/users/lcars/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 06:58

Security System :: Networking :: Firewalls

About: The Firewall Tester consists of two simple Perl scripts: the client
part (ftest) and the listening "daemon" (ftestd). The client injects custom
packets, defined in ftest.conf, with a signature in the data part while the
daemon listens for such marked packets. The scripts both write similarly
formatted log files of their activities. If the two scripts are run on
hosts on opposite sides of a firewall, then a diff of the two produced
files shows the packets that were unable to reach the daemon due to
filtering rules. A script called freport is also available to automatically
parse the log files. This is not an automated process, and ftest.conf must
be crafted for every different situation. Examples and rules are included
in the included ftest.conf. 

Changes: A command line option for packet injection was added. Packets are
now tracked also with IP ID field. The freport utility was added for
automatically parsing ftest and ftestd log files.

  by Guillaume Chazarain (http://freshmeat.net/users/booh/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 07:19

Multimedia :: Graphics :: Viewers

About: GLiv is an OpenGL image viewer. Image loading is done through
Gdk-pixbuf (standalone or bundled with GTK+-1.3.x), rendering is done via
OpenGL, and the graphical user interface uses GTK+ with the GtkGLArea
widget. If Gdk-pixbuf cannot load your image, it uses ImageMagick to
convert it to PNG. GLiv is very fast and smooth at rotating, zooming, and
panning if you have an OpenGL accelerated board.  

Changes: Rotation was added and is available with the Control key.
Dithering was added (-t option). The useless function nanosleep() was
removed and minor bugfixes were added.

Scientific/Engineering

About: GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, which was inspired by
both TeX and GNU Emacs. The editor allows you to write structured documents
via a "wysiwyg" and user friendly interface. The program implements high
quality typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts. It is also possible to use
TeXmacs as an interface to computer algebra systems. Finally, TeXmacs
supports the Guile/Scheme extension language, which makes it possible to
adapt the user interface to specific needs, and even to extend the editor.

Changes: A page-breaking algorithm as fast as the previous in the case of
one flow, forward deletion for non-structured text, and a more user
friendly way of entering title information for articles were added. Several
bugs were fixed, including some related to spell checking and vertical
spacing. This release marks the freeze of TeXmacs, with no new features to
be added before version 1.0.

[030] - mapscsi 0.0.9 (Development)
  by Michael Clark (http://freshmeat.net/users/metaparadigm/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 07:18

System :: Boot System :: Hardware

About: mapscsi is a Linux SCSI device mapping tool which solves the problem
of SCSI device names being allocated in the order of probing. The problem
is that when an additional device is added and has a lower host, channel,
or ID than existing devices, the other devices will all be shuffled along
on the next reboot (i.e. /dev/sdb becomes /dev/sdc, etc.). mapscsi solves
this by creating symbolic links to Linux SCSI devices after scanning all
SCSI devices, using information probed from the devices and a set of
mapping rules containing device templates to dynamically create link names.
mapscsi can fetch Fibre Channel world wide names and loop IDs when using
Qlogic HBAs with the qla2x00 driver. mapscsi is a simple alternative to
devfs, and provides the added ability of including drive information such
as vendor/product/Fibre channel address details, PCI location, and serial
numbers in device link names. mapscsi is particularily useful in Fibre
Channel SAN environments. 

Changes: A NULL pointer dereference that occured if not all sg devices
could be mapped was fixed.

About: Modular Controller Architecture us a modular, network-transparent,
realtime capable C/C++ framework for controlling robots and other kind  of
hardware. The main plattform is Linux/RTLinux, but support for Win32 and
Solaris also exists.  

Changes: Linux kernel 2.4.16 is now supported. For simulation purposes, the
timing can now be scaled in order to test slower and faster execution.
Mass-data cannot be managed by edges, and therefore network-transparent
blackboards have been integrated into MCA. The implementation is considered
beta. Debug messages are now level-based. Users can determine a level on
startup in order to filter unnecessary debug messages. The plugin mechanism
of the MCAGUI now works reliably both under Windows and Linux.

  by Greg Ward (http://freshmeat.net/users/gward/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 17:33

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Software Development :: Libraries
:: Application Frameworks

About: Quixote is yet another framework for developing Web applications in
Python. The design goals are to allow easy development of Web applications
where the accent is more on complicated programming logic than complicated
templating, to make the templating language as similar to Python as
possible, in both syntax and semantics (the aim is to make as many of the
skills and structural techniques used in writing regular Python code
applicable to Web applications built using Quixote), and to involve no
magic -- when it's not obvious what to do in a certain case, Quixote
refuses to guess. If you view a web site as a program, and web pages as
subroutines, this just might be the tool for you. If you view a web site as
a graphic design showcase, and each web page as an individual work of art,
this is probably not what you're looking for.

Changes: This release adds a demonstration of and documentation for the
Quixote widget library. It has been fixed to work with Python 2.2. The
unnecessary URL_PREFIX config variable.has been removed Various other minor
bugs have been fixed and features added.

[047] - rdiff-backup 0.4.3
  by Ben Escoto (http://freshmeat.net/users/bescoto/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 04:23

System :: Archiving :: Backup Utilities

About: rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another.  The target
directory ends up a copy of the source  directory, but extra reverse diffs
are stored in a special directory so you can still recover files lost  some
time ago. The idea is to combine the best  features of a mirror and an
incremental backup.   rdiff-backup can also operate in a bandwidth-
efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you  can use rdiff-backup
and ssh to securely back up to a remote location, and only the differences
will be transmitted.  It can also handle symlinks, device files,
permissions, ownership, etc., so it can be used on the entire file system.

Changes: Memory leaks were plugged.

[048] - RPL/2 4.00pre3e (Development)
  by JKB (http://freshmeat.net/users/jkb/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 10:41

Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics Software Development :: Interpreters

About: RPL/2 (Reverse Polish Lisp/2) is a langage derived from the RPL made
by Hewlett-Packard for its HP-28S. It has some extensions (preprocessor,
compilated libraries, new functions), a TeX output, and can draw graphics.

Changes: RPL/2 version 4.00pre3d does not compile on many workstations
because it requires a program named texi2man to compile the unit directory.
This program is now included in the tarball for this release.

  by priikone (http://freshmeat.net/users/priikone/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 04:24

Communications Communications :: Chat Communications :: Conferencing

About: SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which
provides secure conferencing services in the Internet over insecure
channels. SILC superficially resembles IRC, although they are very
different internally. The purpose of SILC is to provide secure conferencing
services. Strong cryptographic methods are used to secure all traffic, and
all messages are encrypted and authenticated. The SILC also supports secure
file transferring. The SILC is delivered as SILC Client for end users, SILC
Server for system administrators, and SILC Toolkit for application
developers.

Changes: Security bugs related to password authentication, crashes related
to the IDENTIFY and WHOIS commands, and bugs in the auto-reconnection to
routers were fixed.

[050] - Smarty PHP template engine 1.5.2
  by Monte Ohrt (http://freshmeat.net/users/mohrt/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 14:10

Software Development

About: Smarty is a template engine for PHP. Many other template engines for
PHP provide basic variable substitution and dynamic block functionality.
Smarty takes a step further to be a "smart" template engine, adding
features such as configuration files, template functions, and variable
modifiers, and making all of this functionality as easy as possible to use
for both programmers and template designers. Smarty also converts the
templates into PHP scripts, eliminating the need to parse the templates on
every invocation. This makes Smarty extremely scalable and managable for
large application needs.

Changes: Mostly bugfixes, and a default template function handler.

  by Cameron Simpson (http://freshmeat.net/users/cameron/)
  Tuesday, December 18th 2001 04:29

Internet :: WWW/HTTP Utilities

About: squid_redirect resembles a list of patterns used to zap those
annoying ad banners from web pages, inserting a placeholder GIF. It lives
in the web proxy and so requires no special browser facilities. It's
readily customizable, small, fast, and easy to install.

Changes: Bugs in zapchain were fixed, allowing the use of multiple
redirectors together (i.e. squid_redirect with Squirm and SquidGuard). 
Pattern updates were added.

Games/Entertainment :: Puzzle Games

About: This implementation of tictactoe can have an NxN sized board, where
N is an odd number >= 3. What makes this implementation different from
others is that it does not use lookahead, and still never loses. It is more
of an experiment than anything else.

Changes: Another losing case was fixed. The program is stable enough that
any losses can be fixed by only manipulating different scores.

  by Dave Rolsky (http://freshmeat.net/users/urthman/)
  Wednesday, December 26th 2001 06:06

Database Software Development

About: Alzabo is a two-fold program. Its first function is as a data
modelling tool. Through either a schema creation interface or a custom Perl
program, it allows a programmer to create a set of schema, table, column,
etc. objects that represent a data model. Alzabo is also capable of reverse
engineering an existing data model. Its second function is as a
RDBMS-to-object mapping system. Once you have created a schema, you can use
Alzabo classes to access its data. These classes offer a high-level
interface to common operations such as SQL SELECT, INSERT, DELETE, and
UPDATE commands. 

Changes: A number of small-to-medium bugs were fixed.

[010] - fcron 2.1.0
  by Thibault Godouet (http://freshmeat.net/users/fcron/)
  Wednesday, December 26th 2001 05:59

System

About: Fcron is a periodical command scheduler which aims at replacing
vixie cron, so it implements most of its functionality. It does not assume
that your system is running either all the time or regularly: you can, for
instance, tell fcron to execute tasks every x hours y minutes of system
uptime or to do a job only once in a specified interval of time. You can
also set a nice value to a job, run it depending on the system load
average, and much more.

Changes: PAM support for fcron and fcrontab was added.  Fcron now sends
mail if a job had noticenotrun set and could not be run because of a full
queue.  Fcron now compiles on AIX (but may remain a bit buggy). fcron can
now run on system on which root is not uid/gid 0/0. Setting lavg to (0,0,0)
no longer adds the line to the lavg queue instead of the serial queue. The
vars HOME, USER and SHELL are now correctly assigned.

  by rick (http://freshmeat.net/users/spacemonkey/)
  Wednesday, December 26th 2001 09:47

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: Supasite is a modular Web based content  management system written
in PHP4, with a  mySQL/XML backend. It provides a slick interface  for
editing templates, adding news, and  automatically generating Meta Tags.

whole new template system that uses HTML and the database instead of XML
was added. Some new template variables were also added. Options for
deleting topics/users/blogs were added. Filtering by username/topic/search
query is now allowed when viewing blog entries in the admin script. The
script no longer relies on short_tags and register_globals being On.

[039] - Supercast 1.0.1
  by Matthew Campbell (http://freshmeat.net/users/mattcamp/)
  Wednesday, December 26th 2001 13:23

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio

About: Supercast is a SHOUTcast-compatible streaming   MP3 audio server for
Unix. Its most distinctive  feature is its ability to re-encode the source 
stream at one or more other bit rates, and  broadcast the resulting
stream(s) along with the  original. This makes it easier to simultaneously 
broadcast high-bandwidth and low-bandwidth  streams with the same content. 


Changes: Addition of a source file that was missing in the previous
release.

[040] - The Hoard Memory Allocator 2.1.0
  by Emery Berger (http://freshmeat.net/users/emeryberger/)
  Wednesday, December 26th 2001 10:43

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Hoard is a scalable memory allocator (malloc replacement) for
multithreaded applications. Hoard can dramatically improve your
application's performance on multiprocessor machines. No changes to your
source are necessary; just link it in. Hoard scales linearly up to at least
14 processors. It works on Linux, Solaris, IRIX, AIX, and Windows
NT/2000/XP. 

Changes: Hoard now ships as a DLL for Windows, and includes shared
libraries for other platforms. This release reduces internal fragmentation
for small objects, and incorporates a variety of performance improvements,
including the use of Doug Lea's malloc as a fast backing store. This
version now supports 64-bit Solaris.

  by Tuomas Jormola (http://freshmeat.net/users/tjormola/)
  Wednesday, December 26th 2001 14:22

Desktop Environment :: Gnome

About: Transpanel is a bash script that implements a hack  for GNOME panel
that makes it look transparent.  This is achieved by cutting a slice from
the wall  paper image over which the panel "floats". Then  this slice is
used as the panel background image.

Changes: This release fixes a nasty bug when dealing with images with a
non-4:3 dimensions ratio. There are also a couple of minor fixes.

Old Appindex categories eliminated
by Patrick Lenz (http://freshmeat.net/users/scoop/)
Section: freshmeat
Friday, January 11th 2002 11:07

We've been carrying our old 2-level categorization scheme with us since the
date we switched to the freshmeat II codebase on Jan 30th 2001. Over the
course of the past year, people have been able to move their projects from
the old category scheme to the new scheme. We have also repeatedly
contacted developers, encouraging them to update their project's
categorization. Effective today, all categories left over from freshmeat I
have been eliminated.

[014] - EchoWall Firewall 1.40
  by sbest (http://freshmeat.net/users/sbest/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 05:10

Security System :: Networking System :: Networking :: Firewalls

About: EchoWall is a package for creating an ipchains-based Linux firewall.
It is optimized for the LEAF/LRP distro, but was originally created for
Debian platforms. Its aim is simplicity for entry-level users. It presumes
the user is using a Linux box as a masquerading firewall/router for a
single Class-C address range. It manages services in an interesting way:
Instead of indicating the IP addresses of machines you want to act as
servers, you instead specify them by their MAC address. When run, the
echowall script automatically detects the current IP address associated
with this MAC address. This allows you to connect a service to a machine
whose IP address is dynamically assigned. EchoWall is pre-configured with
extentions that handle the firewalling and port-forwarding needs of over 30
services (eg., NetMeeting, Quake, Direct-X, etc.). VPN passthru and limited
DMZ support are also available. 

Changes: This release adds some fixes to support the 1.x release of
Dachstein which sports a repaired "cut" utility. It also includes version
0.3f of the gatping network scanner for both glibc 2.0.* and 2.1.* systems,
and adds support for the XBox Gateway.

[015] - Email address validation component 2002.01.12
  by Manuel Lemos (http://freshmeat.net/users/mlemos/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 22:55

Internet

About: This is a PHP class that attempts to validate a given e-mail address
at three levels: matching the address against a RFC compliant regular
expression, verifing the existence of the destination SMTP server by
verifying the respective DNS MX record, and connecting to that server to
see if the given address is accepted as a valid recipient. The class also
features a debugging output option that lets you see the remote SMTP server
connection and data exchange dialog to see the real cause why an apparently
valid address may not be accepting messages.

Changes: Replacing all strtok calls by an emulation class function named
Tokenize to avoid the problem of the behaviour that was broken by PHP
developers after version 4.0.6.

About: GLiv is an OpenGL image viewer. Image loading is done through
Gdk-pixbuf (standalone or bundled with GTK+-1.3.x), rendering is done via
OpenGL, and the graphical user interface uses GTK+ with the GtkGLArea

convert it to PNG. GLiv is very fast and smooth at rotating, zooming, and
panning if you have an OpenGL accelerated board.  

Changes: In this release, a dithering bug that caused crashes has been
fixed. The history support has been improved, and there is a new option in
the open dialog to load all files in the directory.

Internet System :: Networking

About: LANdialler allows any computer (Windows, Linux, etc.) on a small LAN
to control and share a modem attached to a *nix server. It is typically
used with IP masquerading or NAT on a Linux router to provide a house or
small office with shared, on-demand, Internet access. 

Changes: This is primarily a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended. If
the external connection script/command fails to bring up the connection
(e.g. your modem isn't plugged into the phone line), version 0.2 would wait
for the connection to come up before allowing an attempt to reconnect. This
version fixes that bug so that when the client's Cancel button is clicked
under these circumstances, the connection attempt is canceled by the
server. The code is also much cleaner.

architecture, it assists in administration of large networks previously
complicated by nonconformant systems. It uses RPM to provide an additional
system layer on top of the operating system. It is fully self-contained (no
RPM pre-installation is required), installs itself by means of a tricky
bootstrapping procedure with minimal operating system intrusion, and
supports multiple installation instances.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site
Management Software Development :: Libraries :: Application Frameworks

About: SiteMesh was built upon the Java Servlet 2.3 API. It is a  web-page
layout system and web-application  integration system to aid in creating
large sites  consisting of many pages for which a consistent  look/feel,
navigation, and layout scheme is  required. It intercepts requests to any
static or  dynamically generated HTML page requested  through the
web-server, parses the page, obtains  properties, and data from the
content, and  generates an appropriate final page with  modifications to
the original. It is ideally suited for Java based sites (particularly JSP)
but can be dropped into any existing site that uses a Servlet engine
including static, CGI, PHP, and ColdFusion generated pages. 

Changes: The package structure has changed from com.sitemesh to
com.opensymphony.module.sitemesh.  A fix has been made for an atrocious
memory leak in PageFilter.  meta http-equiv tags are now added as
properties with the prefix meta.http-equiv.x, where x is the value of the
http-equiv attribute (eg., refresh).  The configuration files are not
case-sensitive anymore.  Many performance optimizations have been made in
FastPageParser.  Various bugfixes and small performance improvements have
been made.

[056] - QtUnit 0.9.2
  by Geert Bevin (http://freshmeat.net/users/gbevin/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 14:11

Software Development :: Quality Assurance Software Development :: Testing

About: QtUnit is a unit testing framework for C++ which compiles into a
shared library. It uses the Qt library for platform independence. Tests can
be compiled into modules which are automatically reloaded after
modification. The text and graphical testrunners are fully localized and
integrate perfectly into IDEs for the display of the exact source location
where failures occurred.

Changes: This release has a more relevant example testcase, better
reporting in case of system exceptions, and better support for detection of
the filename of test cases. A new view of registered tests has been
implemented; the classname is now shown as a seperate list item, and the
tests themselves only display the test method name. Test class listitems
are collapsible to make it easier to work with a lot of test cases.
TestUnit from QObject has been integrated to make it possible to use
signals and slots in testcases and testsuites. NULL has been replaced with
0. A French translation has been added.

[057] - Remote Access Session 0.6
  by Angel Ramos (http://freshmeat.net/users/seamus/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 12:13

Security

About: Remote Access Session is a security tool to analyze the integrity of
systems. The program tries to gain access to a system using the most
advanced techniques of remote intrusion. It can either work in normal mode
(which is fast) or hard mode (which is more intensive). There is a big
difference between Remote Access Session and other remote security audit
tools. If Remote Access Session finds a remote vulnerability that gives
user account or root, it will try to exploit it and it will return a shell.
This allows a network administrator to discard false positives regarding
remote vulnerabilities. It also includes all of the information from
service banners in its output. It performs vendor and version detection on
Web servers and other common servers, and also attempts remote OS
identification.  

Changes: The verify_software function has been rewritten for better
perfomance. 17 new remote exploits for different services have been added.

  by nikhilwiz (http://freshmeat.net/users/nikhilwiz/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 12:10

Communications Communications :: Chat :: ICQ Internet

About: SMSTerm is a Perl script that uses the ICQ2000 protocol to send SMSs
to/from your mobile/computer. It runs a shell on a pty, and allows you to
directly send commands to the shell through SMS. Minimal authentication is
done over SMS before spawning a shell and offering it to the user on the
mobile phone. It is very useful for remote administration tasks, or
checking out the status of the network, or just to run some small chores on
your system while you are away. It uses the Expect.pm module to do its
chores. SMSTerm also includes a script to send SMS through the ICQ network
from the commandline to any GSM mobile.

Changes: Some minor fixes relating to the errors made by ICQ while sending
the SMS receipt have been handled. The Message-ID field in the SMS receipt
has been found to be munged by ICQ. This version fixes this in the main
smsterm.pl script as well as the icqsms-send.pl script.

has unique features such as selective non-indexing, on-the-fly filters,
user-selectable stemming, and more.

Changes: SWISH++ can now index stand-alone RTF files. The thread-pooling
code is now more robust, and better handling of TIME-WAIT state for daemon
connections was added.

About: The poldek is an RPM package management tool which allows you to
easily perform package verification, installation (including system
installation from scratch), upgrading, and removal. Package dependencies
are automatically handled, so if you try to install a package that needs
others to be installed, it will download all needed packages and install
them. It can divide a huge package set into fixed size chunks for the
purpose of placing packages on removable media like CDROM or ZIP. It can be
used in batch (like apt_get from Debian's APT) or interactive mode. The
interactive mode puts you into a readline interface with command line
autocompletion and history, similar to the shell mode of Perl's CPAN.

  by itamarst (http://freshmeat.net/users/itamarst/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 12:12

Communications :: Chat Communications :: Email Games/Entertainment ::
Multi-User Dungeons (MUD)

About: Twisted is an event-based framework for Internet applications. It
includes a Web server, a telnet server, an IRC server, a multiplayer RPG
engine, a generic client/server pair for remote object access, and APIs for
creating new protocols. 

Changes: This release has many bugfixes and feature enhancements for
existing components, including web.guard, twisted.enterprise database
support, and the config interface. New experimental stuff includes
twisted.forum, a database-based web forum, twisted.metrics, a
database-backed performance and stats system, wxPython event loop support,
and initial experimental support for connectTCP and connectSSL, allowing
client protocols such as IRC bots to (re)connect to remote servers
automatically.

[074] - WebPerformance Trainer 2.3 Final
  by Michael S Czeiszperger (http://freshmeat.net/users/czei/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 14:06

Internet :: WWW/HTTP Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management Software
Development :: Testing

About: WebPerformance Trainer is a load, stress, and performance testing
tool for Web servers. It simulates thousands of individual users hitting a
server at connection speeds between 14.4Kb/s and 100Mb/s. It supports URL
rewriting, dynamic form data, multiple servers, and unusual port numbers.
Statistics are collected at multiple levels, from the transaction down to
the individual HTTP request. Users can view, edit, or dynamically replace
hidden data such as the HTTP request and reply headers. It runs on Linux,
Solaris, Windows NT, and Windows 2000. 

Changes: This release fixes an SSL timeout bug, a bug where the user
couldn't edit commands that contain a valueless parameter, a bug where the
user can not load new data set into an existing dataset name, a bug where
UnknownHost errors are not logged, and a bug where changing the value of
one URL parameter and setting a filter (data replacement) for another on
the same URL caused the first parameter to retain it's original value
during test playback. The 'Recent Files' list has been changed so that
items move back to the top of the list when they are used.

[002] - 6's Keen TV Listings Scanner 0.2
  by 6 (http://freshmeat.net/users/num6/)
  Saturday, January 19th 2002 06:46

Communications :: Email Internet :: WWW/HTTP Utilities

About: 6's Keen TV Listings Scanner is a program that  accepts a list of
your favourite TV shows, movies,  actors, and actresses, and running from
crontab,  performs a daily search for them in gist.com's TV  listings
search engine, and emails you a summary of  the results. You get a daily
email listing 15-20  programs that you'd probably like to watch, and, of 
course, gist.com lets you exclude channels that  you cannot access.

Changes: The ability to customize the 'From' address of emails was added.
All cookies returned during the login procedure are now used (instead of
just the session ID).

  by Maroc (http://freshmeat.net/users/maroc/)
  Saturday, January 19th 2002 22:04

Internet :: WWW/HTTP Text Processing Text Processing :: Markup

About: AFT (Almost Free Text) is a document preparation system. It is
mostly free form, meaning that there is little intrusive markup; AFT source
documents look a lot like plain old ASCII text. It has a few rules for
structuring your document, more to do with formatting your text than
embedding lots of commands, and it produces all types of output (HTML,
XHTML, LaTeX, roll-your-own XML, etc.). All that needs to be done is to
edit a rule file. You can even customize your own rule files for
specialized output.

Changes: A new SET pragma to allow you to create variables in the *.dat
files and AFT documents for substitution before and after AFT processing. 
This is an experimental feature that opens AFT up to some interesting
document hackery.

compatibility. 

Changes: Support for Unicode (UTF-8) character information, customised key
mapping for international keyboards, a new user guide, support for PNG
files, translucency and alpha blending effects, fast scrolling, improved
file management, screen savers, a rewritten graphics engine, and removal of
support for X11 window management.

System

About: dlogin is a replacement login which allows automatically adding
users who login via a virtual terminal (local terminal) to a group or list
of groups temporarily. This can be used to allow such a user to shutdown
the system, use the audio device, etc., even if they are not root.  It also
allows "quick logins" (if you have logged in on one VT, you can login on
another without having to enter your username and password again).  

Changes: Problems with older compilers and a bug where quick logins
wouldn't work with some gettys were fixed.

About: FreeMarker allows Java servlets to keep graphic design separate from
application logic, by encapsulating HTML in templates. Templates generate
HTML dynamically, using data provided by the servlet. The template language
is powerful and intuitive, the compiler is fast, and the output approaches
the speed of static HTML pages.

Changes: A fix for a potential vulnerability with the template cache (in
previous releases it was possible to construct a variable that, when passed
to an "include" instruction, could break out of the cache directory
structure, and possibly retrieve sensitive files. This release fixes this
vulnerability by checking for relative paths that try to escape the cache
directory before retrieving the requested file).

About: Mojo Mail is a light-weight Web-based email mailing list manager. It
supports announce-only lists and group discussion lists, as well as
archiving, double opt-in subscriptions, and double opt-out unsubscriptions.
List mailings can be sent using sendmail, qmail, or even with a straight
SMTP connection (either all at once, or in timed batches). All list
administration can be done through your browser via Mojo Mail's
administrative control panel. Creating new lists and administrating them is
easy. Mojo Mail is a great alternative to programs such as Majordomo if you
want to give more control to the actual list owners, who may not have much
experience with such applications. Mojo Mail can be run simply as a CGI
script and needs no special modules installed. The entire look of html
pages created by Mojo Mail can be customized with any template you can
provide, on a list by list basis. 

Changes: The subscription database is now totally removed from the program
itself, meaning you can replace the default PlainText subscription list
with a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.). List names can now be changed at
any time, administration features can be turned on and off (not just
hidden) by the root admin, the admin screens are now fully template-able,
and a simple bounce-handler has been included. The mojo_send.pl script has
been re-written. The main script, mojo.cgi, is now smaller in size.

[057] - travtrack 0.6.1 (travlib)
  by Robert Uhl (http://freshmeat.net/users/eadmund/)
  Saturday, January 19th 2002 04:17

Games/Entertainment Games/Entertainment :: Role-Playing Software
Development :: Libraries

About: travtrack is a tool to help a Traveller referee keep   track of
essential data for a game. Already   implemented are galaxies, sectors,
subsectors,   systems, stars, planets, belt and moons. Yet to be  
implemented are trade routes, ships, characters   and all the rest. These
will take some time, but   should not be too complex. It currently uses the
  GURPS Traveller:First In rules for system   generation, but a subproject
is under way to add   Classic Traveller generation and output. A guile  
interface to the data representation functions is   provided. travlib is a
collection of C routines that   should make writing a Traveller application
easier.

Changes: A major bug where certain functions that should have been in
either libtrav or libtravguile were actually in travshell has been fixed.
The program speed was optimized using gprof. A good deal of debugging code
was removed, a few functions were tweaked, some functions were reordered
for efficiency, and some documentation on the use of the library was added.
Several large and useless files were removed from the distribution,
resulting in a much smaller download (274K instead of 2M).

About: The HTML::Template module attempts to make using HTML templates
simple and natural. It extends standard HTML with a few new tags for
variables, loops, if/else blocks and includes. A file written with HTML and
these new tags is called a template. Using this module you fill in the
values for the variables and loops declared in the template. This allows
you to seperate design (the HTML) from the data, which you generate in the
Perl script. While there are many other HTML template systems available,
this module is simple and fast. It doesn't try to reinvent Perl CGI, it
just augments HTML with a few new and very useful abilities.

Changes: Bugfixes, documentation cleanups, and a new project Web site.

  by Basilios (http://freshmeat.net/users/basilios/)
  Friday, February 1st 2002 06:27

Software Development Software Development :: Build Tools

About: Organon is a project manager that uses the Perl/Tk module. It is
written for those who use stand-alone editors to write their code but would
like to have a tool to manage the file groups they work with. It can be
used with any programming language, and it can be easily tailored to match
your needs. You can configure the standard tools (dedicated to editing,
compilation, and execution), and you can define any number of new user
tools. Each tool (standard or user-defined) is associated with a string
containing shell commands to be executed. 

Changes: Organon can now run projects and execute tools in a terminal
window. The terminal emulator can be defined in the Configure Standard
Tools dialog. The way to define Organon's behavior when capturing stdout
and stderr for standard and user-defined tools is now more flexible: there
is a drop-down menu instead of a group of checkboxes. Finally, the "--path"
command-line switch can now be used to choose a path in which to open the
first project of the session.

[073] - taglog 0.1.30
  by John Lines (http://freshmeat.net/users/paladinfm/)
  Friday, February 1st 2002 03:03

Office/Business :: News/Diary Utilities

About: Taglog is designed for anyone who spends most of their day sitting
at a computer, working on various projects. You can make notes about what
you do, as you go along, associating them with the projects you work on. At
the end of the week you can produce a report of how your time was spent,
broken down by project for booking purposes. You can view previous entries,
by date, or by project. You can enter the actions you intend to take,
associate them with a project, and mark them as active, or complete.

Changes: The active project can now be switched from the Projects/View
window by clicking on the project labels, allowing taglog to be run with
the main window iconified. This saves screen space on systems where this is
limited.

[079] - Vstr string library 0.7.2
  by Nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  Friday, February 1st 2002 02:16

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. It works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la "C strings". It can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

Changes: This release adds some extra functions, including vstr_split()
which works similar to perl split() (although no regexp), functions to
parse numbers from a string, and "shortcut" functions for
mapping/reading/writing fds with the string.  Some extra examples were also
added, including an "nl" command.

[001] - An MP3 LEnder 0.5.3 (Development)
  by David H (http://freshmeat.net/users/Alphix/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 08:39

Communications :: File Sharing Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers
Multimedia :: Sound/Audio

About: Ample is a simple MP3 server written in C. It does not support
mixing, radio shows, etc. Ample is just intended to be an easy way to
remotely listen to your MP3s using the "open location" features in XMMS,
WinAmp, and Media Player.

Changes: SysV IPC (SHM) is now used to store the file information (where
available), which should save physical memory. Some memory leaks were
fixed. Man pages were added and HTML template support was implemented (to
customize the Web pages generated by Ample).

About: AntiBoard is a small and compact multi-threaded bulletin board
system written in PHP. It uses either MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database
backend, and has support for different languages. It is not meant as the
end all be all of bulletin boards, but rather something to easily integrate
into your own page.

[003] - Application Version Management 1.1 (Beta)
  by Jon (http://freshmeat.net/users/jondkent/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 12:42

About: Application Version Management (avm) allows you to have multiple
versions of the same application available on one system, or via NFS. It is
mainly a bash/bourne shell function, which uses a centralised configuration
file (avm.conf) to define the location of the app, and the default version
(which can be overridden). The only restriction is that the directory
scheme must follow the avm standard. Basic installation and usage
documention is available. 

Changes: This release has support for dependencies, although just for the
top tier avm package at present. You can define whether a package depends
upon one or more other packages, and these will be automatically
initialized when you Load the package. This is useful if the package has a
lot of dependencies upon other avm packages.

[005] - AVL C Library 0.4
  by Daniel Nagy (http://freshmeat.net/users/nagydani/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 11:23

Software Development :: Libraries

About: This data structure features fast (O(log N)) insertion, removal, and
retrieval of records, provided that there is a sorting relation over their
keys and there are no entries with equal keys. The AVL tree is an explicit
binary searching tree, where left children of each vertex are less or
equal, while right children are greater or equal than the vertex itself. In
addition, the tree is balanced so that the difference between the depths of
the two subtrees of each vertex is at most one.

Changes: New features include range iteration (a longstanding TODO item),
Debian packaging, full ANSI C compliance, and a minor code cleanup.

[006] - BaseML Off Line Content Management 0.3
  by MoobY (http://freshmeat.net/users/Moobs/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 12:48

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management Software Development :: Compilers
Text Processing :: Markup

About: BaseML is a tool/compiler to manage and construct  Web sites. To
create a Web site, you provide BaseML with a set of "source" XML files 
that contain the styling and contents of your web  site. The source code
format is a mix between  XML/XHTML components and procedural  programming.
Some concepts taken from object  orientation (such as
inheritance/overloading and  containers) facilitate managing cascading
styles,  contents, and containers of documents.  

Changes: BaseML is now independent from Qt. It now includes its own

[007] - bash programmable completion 20020213
  by Ian Macdonald (http://freshmeat.net/users/ianmacd/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 12:44

System :: Shells Utilities

About: Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and
extend its standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines
with just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to
complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3 str
[Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX
manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems
from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all targets
in Makefile. This project was conceived to produce programmable completion
routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of
typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis. 

Changes: This release fixes an "out of memory" error in _tcpdump() and a
bug in the one-liners that caused broken completion for any spec broken
over multiple lines.

Internet Printing Security

About: CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based operating
systems. It has been developed to promote a standard printing solution for
all UNIX vendors and users. CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley
commandline interfaces, uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the
basis for managing print jobs and queues, supports (with reduced
functionality) the Line Printer Daemon ("LPD"), Server Message Block
("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a. JetDirect) protocols, and adds network
printer browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD")-based printing
options to support real-world printing under UNIX. CUPS also includes a
customized version of GNU Ghostscript and an image file RIP that are used
to support non-PostScript printers. Sample drivers for HP and EPSON
printers are included that use these filters.

Changes: This is a security release that fixes two buffer overflow bugs in
the IPP code, adds a Swedish message catalog and support for the Linux
devfs printer devices, fixes MacOS X build problems, fixes a problem in
cupsaddsmb with some versions of SAMBA, and adds compatibility with an IBM
implementation of IPP.

[037] - JEL 0.9.10
  by Konstantin L. Metlov (http://freshmeat.net/users/metlov/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 12:52

Software Development :: Compilers Software Development :: Libraries

About: JEL (Java Expressions Library) is a library for evaluating simple
single-line expressions in Java. The key feature of JEL is the fact that it
is a compiler. The language of JEL expressions resembles the Java Language
expressions as close as possible. JEL supports all Java primitive types and
classes (even in the form of constants), allows one to call both static and
virtual methods of Java classes (with no additinal runtime costs and no
wrappers), and performs evaluation of constant subexpressions at a compile
time. 

Changes: Size decreases, improved compilation performance due to reduced
heap allocations, internal representations of the expressions by tree, and
a new hand-written parser.

[050] - mod_SQLInclude 1.4 (Stable)
  by Carlos (http://freshmeat.net/users/wfmh/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 19:05

About: mod_sqlinclude is an Apache Web server module which implements an
include-alike command which includes the external data into an Apache
configuration file. But instead of including the contents of a file,
SQLInclude fetches and includes data from a MySQL database. 

Changes: The default 'sqlinclude' database name module used to fallback if
SQLI_SQLDB was not specified has been removed, which may lead to connection
problems. If in Verbose mode, the module logs more details as to which
server it's about to connect and as who. This helps in debugging broken
httpd configurations. The Verbose option is now expanded, allowing you to
define the 'talkative' level of the module.

  by jkraai (http://freshmeat.net/users/jkraai/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 12:40

About: PHPMyEdit has two components, a table preprocessor and an interface
generator. You can run the preprocessor against a MySQL table with your

insert, copy, update, and delete records.  You can easily add relational
support tables.  The generated file can be "pasted" into an existing Web
site framework by simply including the generated include file. 

Changes: Two new actions were added: View Detail and Copy Record. An
initial filters capability has been added both at the table level and the
supporting table levels. The 'format' option has been replaced with 'mask',
which is processed by printf() before displaying. The listing limit can be
set to -1 to specify all the rows on a page. It is now possible to have
multiple initial sort fields which are retained as
secondary/tertiary/quaternary/etc. Default values are now supported.
Numeric filter fields now have in/equality operators.

[070] - SCMxx 0.5.13
  by Hendrik Sattler (http://freshmeat.net/users/hsattler/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 08:45

Communications

About: SCMxx is a console program that allows you to exchange certain types
of data with mobile phones made by Siemens. Some of the data types that can
be exchanged are logos, ring tones, vCalendars, vCards, phonebook entries,
and SMS messages. It works with the following phones: S25, C35i, M35i,
S35i, ME45, S45, SL45, and probably some others, too. It basically uses the
AT command set published by Siemens (with some other additional
resources).

Changes: This release fixes an issue with masked characters in the
description field of phonebook entries. Building from source now uses
autoconf/autoheader instead of a static Makefile.

office, and  has proven to be very handy.

Changes: Installation instructions have been added. footer.php was modified
to include a new email address.

[075] - The Network Daemon Exploder 0.3 (Stable)
  by Daniel Dent (http://freshmeat.net/users/ddent/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 08:42

Communications :: Chat :: Internet Relay Chat Internet Software Development
:: Testing :: Traffic Generation

About: This program was written to help test the Open Projects dancer-ircd.
It simulates client activity by selecting random servers to connect to and
random actions out of a list. It can handle hundreds of simultaneous
connections, and can replay a log file of what it has previously done in
order to help isolate the actions which cause the daemon to have problems,
using methods such as binary chops. Please note that although at this point
code is only written to test ircds, it is hoped that this will be extended
in the future to other types of daemons.

Changes: A bug which occurred when multiple lines were read in one
sysread() was fixed. This bug sometimes prevented ping replies from being
sent.

  by Chris Waterson (http://freshmeat.net/users/waterson/)
  Wednesday, February 13th 2002 15:47

Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence

About: TinySoar is an implementation of the Soar artificial intelligence
architecture that is intended to run on a memory-constrained device, like a
robot. Soar is a "real time'' performance runtime that incorporates acting,
planning, and learning in a rule-based framework. TinySoar includes
alternative firmware for the Lego Mindstorms RCX, so you can control a Lego
robot with a Soar agent.

Changes: This release fixes several bugs and includes some minor
enhancements. Notable bugfixes include proper support of the Soar 8.2
decision cycle, several runtime fixes for o-support, and fixes to the rule
parser. The Lego RCX motor interface uses symbolic constants instead of
integral constants, allowing support for `brake' as well as `freewheel'.

a user can manipulate objects in the environment with the mouse and add new
ones with a seperate program. 

Changes: New features include the ability to load a model for your avatar
(no more blue spheres!), better object maniplution with the mouse, some new
utilities for the 3D client, and fixes for some crashing bugs in the core.

contains other not-so-common data types such as Finite State Machine Graph
and Editor Buffer. The library is designed to be versatile for the
programmer. For example, the linked list utilizes both inheritance and
templates to allow a single instance of a data structure to be an element
in multiple lists. In general, Aapl data structures do not have private
data members and are thus not abstracted away. 

Changes: Walkable versions of all AvlTrees were added. This was a
long-standing missing feature. AvlTree can now compete with STL map and
other similar classes. AvlSet, a key-only oriented AvlTree, was added. Test
cases for new code was written.

Software Development :: Build Tools Software Development :: Testing
Software Development :: Version Control

About: Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management
system. It provides a framework within which a team of developers may work
on many changes to a program independently, and Aegis coordinates
integrating these changes back into the master source of the program, with
as little disruption as possible. Aegis supports geographically distributed
development.

Changes: A fix for a bug in the aecp --delta command (it retrieves the
correct version for files not yet changed by the branch, and as a bonus it
goes much faster), fixes for a number of oversights in handling the new
"awaiting review" state, a fix for a bug in the symbolic link maintenance
code so it repairs links which point to a file which is too deep in the
ancestor tree and has been subsequently replaced (and as a bonus it goes
about twice as fast), and numerous other bugfixes and enhancements.

[009] - bash programmable completion 20020225
  by Ian Macdonald (http://freshmeat.net/users/ianmacd/)
  Monday, February 25th 2002 02:43

System :: Shells Utilities

About: Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and
extend its standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines
with just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to
complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3 str
[Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX
manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems
from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all targets
in Makefile. This project was conceived to produce programmable completion
routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of
typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis. 

Changes: This issue fixes a compgen error in some long options of RPM
completion. In pSQL completion, we now try to get list of valid users from
Postgres before resorting to system user list. mkdir and rmdir now complete
only on directories and long options. cd completion was ignoring $CDPATH,
which has been fixed. A bug causing compgen errors in tar completion when
the first parameter started with hyphen has been fixed. A bug in
_known_hosts() where defaulting to standard hostname completion would yield
a compgen error has also been fixed.

About: Cyberbrau is a Web-based program to help the homebrewer. It allows
for very simple and intuitive beer, cider, and mead recipe creation, and it
automatically calculates all the pertinent information based on the
selected ingredients and schedule. In addition to the recipes, it allows
multiple brewers to privately track their own batches, emailing them on
racking, bottling, and lagering dates. Finally, it has a 'taster's review'
section which allows those who try your brew to rate and comment on the
batch. This information goes into the overall recipe ranking.  

Changes: Numerous bugfixes have been made, as well as many new features.
Recipe calculation enhancements were made, a search engine was added, some
batch creation screens were made to be more intuitive, and an easy to use
installer was added.

About: FreeVMS is an OpenVMS-like operating system which can run on several
architectures like i386, PPC, Alpha, and many others. It consists of a
POSIX kernel and a DCL command line interpreter. The only architecture
currently supported is i386. 

Changes: New features have been written for this kernel, such as IPLs and
other interrupt related stuff. If you test this kernel, the developers
would like to have some feedback about all troubles you can find.

[036] - GeoTools 0.8.0 (Stable)
  by James Macgill (http://freshmeat.net/users/jmacgill/)
  Monday, February 25th 2002 13:22

Internet :: WWW/HTTP Multimedia :: Graphics Multimedia :: Graphics ::
Viewers

About: GeoTools is a Java toolkit for developing interactive geographical
maps. The emphasis is on client-side mapping applets which require little
or no server-side support. The main file format is the ESRI shapefile.

Changes: In addition to general bugfixes and improved stability, the
creation of this release involved more the removal of code than the
addition of anything new.   GeoTools has undergone continuous active
development since its last official release over a year ago: much of it,
however, experimental. In order to provide a stable release, it was
therefore decided to package together all of the most important code, while
excluding the newer, experimental code.  The result is a more compact
release featuring stable code that will be of interest to the majority of
end users.

  by Peter Samuel (http://freshmeat.net/users/petersamuel/)
  Monday, February 25th 2002 16:39

Software Development :: Build Tools System :: Archiving :: Packaging System
:: Software Distribution Tools

About: Graft provides a mechanism for managing multiple packages under a
single directory hierarchy. It was inspired by both Depot (from Carnegie
Mellon University) and Stow (by Bob Glickstein). Packages are installed in
self-contained directory trees and symbolic links from a common area are
made to the package files.

Changes: The previous version would carry the contents of a .graft-include
file into other directories. This resulted in these subsequent directories
being ignored. This version fixes that bug.  A NEVERGRAFT Makefile
directive has been added so that files and/or directories such as CVS, RCS,
etc. are never grafted. The list is specified in the Makefile and
controlled by the -C command line option.

[053] - KDE Popper 0.93
  by emmCee (http://freshmeat.net/users/emmC/)
  Monday, February 25th 2002 06:48

Communications Desktop Environment :: K Desktop Environment (KDE)

About: Popper is a small, neat solution to messaging between Linux and
Windows-based machines.  It sits quietly in the system tray and pops up a
message should one be received from a computer on the network. All 32-bit
Windows variants come with some sort of messaging program compatible with 
these kind of messages, and there are several available for Linux. Samba
provides the  neccessary magic of sending and receiving. 

Changes: This release changes the received message mechanism to use file
modification times instead of signals so that the executable no longer
needs to be suid. It now allows for systems that don't have an
/etc/HOSTNAME or one that has dubious contents, and the popper-send.sh
script has been introduced so it will now receive messages.

About: KDirStat (KDE Directory Statistics) is a small utility  program that
sums up disk usage for direcory trees, very much like the Unix 'du'
command.   It displays the disk space used up by a directory tree, both
numerically and graphically. It is network transparent (i.e., you can use
it to sum up FTP servers), and comes with predefined and user configurable 
cleanup actions.  You can directly open a directory branch in Konqueror or
the shell of your choice, compress it to a .tar.bz2 archive, or define your
own cleanup actions.  

Changes: The online help texts were completed, "help" buttons were added to
all dialogs, and logging to stdout was drastically reduced. This is the
final stable release, and is the official version of KDirStat for KDE 2.x.

[055] - Keepalived for LVS 0.5.3 (Development)
  by Alexandre Cassen (http://freshmeat.net/users/acassen/)
  Monday, February 25th 2002 00:13

Internet System System :: Clustering/Distributed Networks

About: Keepalived for LVS aims to add a strong and robust keepalive
facility to the Linux Virtual Server project. This project is written in C,
with multi-layer TCP/IP stack checks. Keepalived implements a framework
based on three family checks: Layer3, Layer4, and Layer5/7. This framework
gives the daemon the ability to check LVS server pool states. When one of
the servers of the LVS server pool is down, Keepalived informs the Linux
kernel via a setsockopt call to remove this server entry from the LVS
topology.

Changes: In this version, autoconf/automake scripts were added, the
configuration file parser was rewritten to use compiler design, and the
global data structures were redesigned. Some template libraries (vector,
list) were created, along with a checker API. An SSL stream handling race
condition was fixed, and new template structures are used.

About: LFSMake is a set of makefiles to automate the installation of a
"Linux from scratch" system. A bit like the FreeBSD Ports collection, these
allow you to download, compile, and install the basic packages required for

Changes: A long-overdue update was made to support the latest releases of
basic packages, roughly corresponding to release 3.1 of the LFS book. This
also breaks up the single large "lfs" makefile into 54 individual files:
one for each package plus a couple of high-level makefiles. This is to
simplify maintenance and to encourage contributions from the community.
Add-on packages for X, KDE, browsers, and such have not yet been updated.

handling of the various mc tools has been standardized. "mcstats" has been
added to give bandwidth stats on a stream. The audio stretcher control
algorithm has been documented and tuned (test reports are welcome). A
possible overflow (causing streaming to break after 6 continuous days) has
hopefully been fixed.

Scientific/Engineering :: Astronomy Software Development :: Libraries

About: Planetizer is a Java API for the orbital dynamics of the Solar
System. It comprises a set of lightweight, easy-to-use, extensible classes
that be used as an astrodynamics engine for any Java application. After
deploying the jar file, the heliocentric, geocentric, and local horizontal
positions as well as other orbital information of the planets and the Moon
can be found as a function of time by solving Kepler's equation from the
mean elements with secular and periodic perturbations.

Changes: A new package "org.planetizer.solarsystem" has been added to
contain most of the orbital dynamics classes. Several exceptions have been
added. SolarSystemPositions has been deprecated, with its functionality now
included in SolarSystem. The initialize()method of several classes,
including SolarSystem, has been deprecated, with the functionality now
included in the constructor. The downloaded files also contain the source
code for the Orbitarium Web Service.

[096] - Sophie 1.18
  by Vanja Hrustic (http://freshmeat.net/users/vanja/)
  Monday, February 25th 2002 14:51

Security System

About: Sophie is a daemon which uses 'libsavi' library from Sophos anti
virus vendor ( http://www.sophos.com ). On startup, Sophie initializes SAPI
(Sophos Anti-Virus Interface), loads virus patterns into memory, opens
local UNIX domain socket, and waits for someone to connect and instructs it
which path to scan. Since the database is loaded in RAM, scanning is very
fast. (Note: speed of scanning also depends on SAVI settings and size of
the file.) It works on Linux, Solaris (Sparc/x86), HP-UX, and FreeBSD. It
was made as a part of 'Virge' project, which is a mail/attachment/virus
scanning tool, written in C.

Changes: Sophie can now run as a user other than root. setpriority() has
been removed. An eicar.com test file is now created during compilation (to
avoid triggering anti-virus alerts when the Sophie archive is scanned).
There are SYSLOG_FACILITY and SYSLOG_LEVEL cleanups, and support for 10 new
config options in libsavi. SOPHIE_TIMEOUT has been increased to 90
seconds.

  by John Ellis (http://freshmeat.net/users/gqview/)
  Monday, February 25th 2002 00:11

Desktop Environment :: Gnome Multimedia :: Sound/Audio

About: Sound Monitor is a GNOME panel applet that displays a vu meter,
oscilliscope, or spectrum analyzer of the output of the esound daemon. The
esound server information can be displayed, and the volume can be adjusted
for active application streams and samples. An extra program, esdpvd, is
included that will allow saving of stream volumes between sessions. Newer
versions include a theme editor.

Changes: The theme engine has been completely rewritten (it now uses the
one in GQmpeg). A spectrum analyzer is now in place, nine new themes have
been added, and a built in skin editor is available. Also notable is that
the sound latency is now accounted for, if the default does not correctly
adjust to match the sound card output, the timing can be adjusted in the
advanced properties.

I've set up two Beowulfs so far, and in both cases it involved gathering
material from various Web sites and somehow putting it all together. I got
everything up and running, but it was quite a "time sink" for me, so I was
interested to receive a book entitled "How to Build a Beowulf".  Finally,
information regarding Beowulfs would be available in one place and I could
save my bandwidth for other stuff!

About: Arianne is a virtual world. It is a massively multiplayer role
playing game you access through an Internet connection. You choose your own
virtual life and immerse yourself into a huge, wild new world, where you

Changes: The server is now more stable. Commandline option support (-exit,
-disconnect player_connection, -list, and -create object_type) and secure
logins via RSA were added to the server. libArianneClient was added so all
the calls the client could need are in this class, making the creation of a
new Arianne client simple. The current client can still only perform a set
of predefined actions that show off the engine.

  Saturday, March 9th 2002 11:33

Software Development :: Interpreters Software Development :: Libraries

About: The OST ccscript package offers a class extensible threaded embedded
scripting engine for use with the Common C++ GNU package. This engine is
also used in Bayonne (the GNU telephony server), and in TOSI (FreeBSD and
GNU/Linux PBX integration servers). This engine differs from traditional
scripting systems in that it is used to script near real-time state-event
systems through deterministic callback step execution rather than the
linear and non-deterministic fashion of embedded script libraries such as
tcl, and libguile.

Changes: Multi-line if-then-else-endif and case/endcase logic, local label
support, and retargeted return fix.

[011] - CG_spam_filter.pl 1.2
  by Viraj Alankar (http://freshmeat.net/users/valankos/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 16:03

Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: CG_spam_filter.pl provides a content filter program for the Stalker
CommuniGate Pro mail server that seeks to limit the number of outgoing spam
your local users can send. In essence, it is a throttling script that
starts rejecting mail sent by your local users once they reach a certain
threshold (X messages or recipients per minute). It is difficult to catch
spammers until after the fact (when they have already done lots of damage
and spammed many users); this is simply an effort to stop them in their
tracks in real-time so you can deal with them later. 

Changes: Throttling based on repeat occurrence of a subject was added. SQL
queries were split up instead of using joins. Some minor bugs were fixed.

[014] - Common C++ 1.9.6
  by Peter Koczan (http://freshmeat.net/users/tobo/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 06:37

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Common C++ is a highly portable C++ class library meant primarily
for the development of portable threaded applications. A separate source
tree is maintained for both pthread "POSIX" targets (Linux, xBSD, Solaris,
etc), and for Win32 targets. The goal is to provide a truly common C++
framework for writing portable threaded applications that do not require a
huge amount of runtime overhead to support, and hence can make C++ and
threads suitable even for the development of trivial servers and
applications.

Changes: Fixes in URL get for ccAudio URLs that do file manipulations, in
xml.cpp (for gcc 3.x support), for the exception header check bug, for bugs
related to newer versions of autoconf and automake, and for 64-bit MD5s
were added. An interface binding patch is included.

  by VAB (http://freshmeat.net/users/alexbrennen/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 03:27

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: cwebldap is a CGI program written in ANSI C which uses the LDAP API
to allow web clients to query an LDAP directory. It uses a configuration
file to determine what to  display from the directory. The configuration
file allows you to set maximum result set size, schema information, binding
information, and LDAP server information.

Changes: Improvements were added to the data structure code. A segfault on
null values, handling of attributes with multiple values, and a minor
memory leak in the data structures were fixed. Email addresses stored in
the standard schema are no longer linked with mailto.

  Saturday, March 9th 2002 03:28

Communications :: Email Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (DCC) is a system of clients and
servers that collect and count checksums related to mail messages. The
counts can be used by SMTP servers and mail user agents to detect and
reject bulk mail. DCC servers can exchange common checksums. The checksums
include values that are "fuzzy", or constant across common variations in
bulk messages. 

Changes: Compression in the database was improved and the bandwidth
required for flooding was reduced.

[019] - Enterprise Object Broker 0.30 (Development)
  by Paul Hammant (http://freshmeat.net/users/paulhammant/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 08:17

Software Development :: Object Brokering

About: Enterprise Object Broker (EOB) is an application server that
transparently distributes Java objects via their interfaces. Because of
this EOB makes no distinction between Local and Remote objects, hence is
not J2EE compliant. The developer builds beans that implement normal Java
interfaces and the deployer decides where the beans are in a cluster of
servers. AltRMI is used in place of RMI. It publishes plain interfaces
locally and remotely. The interfaces do not have to extend the Remote
interface. Methods do not have to throw RemoteException. EOB sits on top of
Apache's Avalon-Phoenix server platform. 

Changes: This release adds an example that uses ForumDemo from Velocity and
a binary download (showing only the forum demo) for those with short
attention spans, so they can launch EOB and point a browser at the pages it
serves.

[020] - GNOME Installation Guide 03/2002
  by karsten reincke (http://freshmeat.net/users/reincke/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 08:25

Desktop Environment :: Gnome

About: The GNOME Installation Guide was written to help unfamiliar users
install a stable GNOME system that includes more than the default
applications.  It teaches readers how to compile GNOME on their own instead
of installing precompiled packages.  It also covers installation of extra
GNOME programs, both those hosted by the GNOME project and those which are
not. 

Changes: Beside the update of the description of many of the GNOME 1.4.1
applications, a new installation guide for GNOME 2.0 has been added. This
new guide is completed by a review which is titled "Why I probably won't
directly upgrade onto GNOME 2.0 or Why normal users perhaps will be
disappointed by GNOME 2.0".

[023] - GNU gengetopt 2.6
  by Peter Koczan (http://freshmeat.net/users/tobo/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 06:42

Software Development Utilities

About: gengetopt takes an easy-to-do description of options and generates a
C function that uses the GNU getopt_long(3) function to parse the options
and validate them. gengetopt is GNU software, but the code generated is not
under any particular license. gengetopt is perfect if you are too lazy to
write all the stuff required to call GNU getopt_long(3), or if you have a
program and wish it took many options. The generated code works if you use
autoconf or automake.

Changes: Defaults are now used for func-name and file-name, the empty line
at the end of the .ggo file is no longer required, and an update for
gengetopt_count_line within TOK_MLSTRING was added. A much more modern
version was taken from the GNU C library.

[024] - GNUnilink 1.6
  by Simon Wood (http://freshmeat.net/users/mungewell/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 08:24

About: GNUnilink is a PIC adaptor that emulates a Sony Auto CD
Multichanger, enabling the AUX input on the rear of suitable Sony car
radios. This in turns allows the owner of such a radio to use these inputs
for a portable CD or MP3 player. GNUnilink contains an optional serial link
between PIC and PC.  Button presses can be sent to the PC.  The PC can set
disk/track numbers/names and provide a real-time counter.

Changes: Big changes to the layout of the file (and hopefully not too any
bugs) have been added.  The project is now split into a series of files to
make editing easier.  MiniDisk emulation has been started, although this
does not appear to work with the author's head unit.  Serial input has been
adjusted to allow for up to 255 tracks when in MiniDisk mode.  The
receiving code has been improved to handle commands of all lengths; this is
required to process the medium and long commands. The output serial names
have been changed to be more generic.  Some general formating and code
optimizations have been added.

  Saturday, March 9th 2002 17:34

Internet Security System :: Monitoring

About: Knocker is a simple, versatile, and easy-to-use TCP security port
scanner written in C, using threads. It is able to analyze hosts and the
network services which are running on them. Knocker it is available for
Linux, FreeBSD, many Unix platforms, and Windows 95/98/2000. Both a console
version and a GTK+ version are available.

Changes: A serious bug that was preventing knocker from scanning a number
of ports greater than 1023 was fixed. Previously, all ports scanned after
the 1023rd one were reported as closed. Another bug that was causing
knocker to segfault before exiting if a hostname couldn't be resolved was
fixed.

[033] - lin-setibuf 1.8.2
  by Emmanuele Bassi (http://freshmeat.net/users/zefram/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 12:13

About: Lin-SETIBuf creates a stack of Work Units for the SETI@Home Project
text client, and then elaborates them sequentially, thus reducing the spare
time between them. It also displays the actual status of each Work Unit in
the stack, permits modification of the stack dimension on-the-fly, and
allows elaboration or download of only one Work Unit. 

Changes: This release fixes bugs in the --add and --proxy options; users
could use Lin-setibuf's variables while defining other variables or
metacommands in the last release.  The --cycle option now begins the stack
run anew.  The internals have been reviewed.  A contrib/ directory has been
created for scripts/add-ons.  Parallel download is now used for work units.

About: Mp3Kult is an application for KDE 2. It organizes your MP3/Ogg
collection in a MySQL database. It can read MP3/Ogg tags and song
information (length, bit rate, sample rate, etc.), make playlists, play
songs with an external player (xmms, gqmpeg), find a song in database (base
and advanced search), and make a copy of a playlist on your hard disk (to
play the playlist without inserting CDROMs). Mp3Kult can recursivly scan
directories to find MP3/Ogg files, and it can automatically mount, umount,
and eject a CDROM before/after a job. 

Changes: Support for Ogg files was added, although the editor for Ogg tags
isn't implemented yet. selection mode was updated, and selection with the
Ctrl key now works. History and completion mode were added in the "Add Mp3"
and "Add Volume" windows. Both the text and numeric versions of the genre
is now written in ID3 v2.x tags. The previous version read and wrote only a
number for the genre. The length calculations for VBR MP3s were corrected.
The ability to search through closed volumes in tree view mode. Database
creation can now be performed from within Mp3Kult itself, without using the
mp3kultdb script.

passphrase is entered. RFC2015 multipart messages can be sent and received
with help from some scripts, procmail, and a patch to Pine. There is a high
level of configurability.  

Changes: Support for RFC2015 multipart messages (requires a patch to Pine
for sending, and help from a script and procmail for receiving), a
pre-built binary that is statically linked against the GNAT stuff so that
people don't need to acquire GNAT first,  nd a new ability to send and
receive (deprecated) application/pgp messages.

class. A bug which caused an error code to be prepended as text to all
contents returned by syndicator even when there was no error was fixed. A
problem in which syndicator would return error 407 (Unrecognized operation)
instead of contents was fixed.

mode. For compatibilty reasons, small changes in the PHP code were made
(the bcpow function is no longer used).

System :: Hardware System :: Networking System :: Networking :: Monitoring

About: Access Point SNMP Conf is an ncurses-based utility to configure
Access Points based on Atmel chipset via the SNMP protocol (the case for

fixed. This bug may have caused problems configuring absolutely new APs. A
safer Known APs function was written, which restores parameters after
requesting the information of known APs. Verbose parameter descriptions
were added.

mechanism, slideshows, HTTP upload, auto-thumbnailing, frame-resistant
bookmarking, SSL compliance, complete user documentation, auto-signup with
demo images, and more. 

Changes: The sample image was split out of the source tarball, so that the
source tarball is 100K instead of 19MB. Added better tracking and
management of uploaded archives. Added user quotas. The code was made
object-oriented, and it is now much smaller and more maintainable.
areaj-upload no longer inflates to the capacity of physical RAM. All file
path data stored in the DB is now relative instead of absolute. Various
captioning/privacy/admin issues were fixed. Diary feature fixes were made.
Empty-result-set behaviour was improved, bringing you back to the search
page. Lots of smaller bugs were fixed.

[016] - Dnsmasq 1.4
  by Simon Kelley (http://freshmeat.net/users/simonkelley/)
  Thursday, March 21st 2002 15:59

Internet :: Name Service (DNS)

About: Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder designed to
provide DNS (domain name) services to a small network where using BIND
would be overkill. It can be have its upstream DNS servers automatically
configured by PPP or DHCP and it can serve the names of local machines
which are not in the global DNS. It can integrate with the ISC DHCP daemon
to serve the names of local machines which are configured using DHCP.
Dnsmasq is ideal for networks behind NAT routers and connected via modem,
ISDN, ADSL, or cable-modem connections.

Changes: A bug which meant that DHCP lease times were wrongly calculated on
time zones other than UTC has been fixed.

[047] - PXE client and server samples 3.0pxe2 (Development)
  by frenchy (http://freshmeat.net/users/biljrat/)
  Thursday, March 21st 2002 15:39

System :: Boot

About: PXE client and server samples provides open source  examples of a
PXE compliant DHCP, proxyDHCP, and  bootserver; and PXE client network
bootstrap  programs. The bootserver adds functionality to the  ISC DHCP
v3.0 daemon in the form of a source  patch, so it can respond correctly to
PXE client  requests. The core functionality of the ISC DHCP  daemon is
unchanged until PXE specific statements  are added to the configuration
file. Sample  configuration files and a man page on the new  statements are
included in the patch.

Changes: A fix for a crash in the ack_lease() routine when running a server
in proxyDHCP mode.

[049] - pyDDR 0.4.1
  by theGREENzebra (http://freshmeat.net/users/tgz/)
  Thursday, March 21st 2002 06:52

Games/Entertainment Games/Entertainment :: Simulation

About: PyDDR is a clone of DDR ("Dance Dance Revolution") written in
Python. The idea of DDR is simple. There's a mat with four directional
arrows, and the game scrolls arrows up the screen to the beat while playing
a song. When the arrows reach the top of the screen (not sooner and not
later), the player hits the corresponding arrow on the pad, and given that
it's hit on time with the beat, points are scored. Based on how well the
dance is put together, s/he is graded at the end of the song.

Changes: In this release, the lifebar is fairer, and tells you when you've
failed. MSD2STEP now tries to write more accurate STEP files. Two annoying
sprite bugs were also fixed.

  Thursday, March 21st 2002 18:42

System :: Boot

About: SYSLINUX is a boot loader for the Linux operating system which
operates off of MS-DOS floppies. It is intended to simplify first-time
installation of Linux, rescue disks, and other uses for boot floppies. A
SYSLINUX floppy can be manipulated using standard MS-DOS (or any other OS
that can access an MS-DOS filesystem) tools once it has been created, and
requires only a ~ 8K DOS program or ~ 16K Linux program to create it in the
first place. It also includes PXELINUX, a program to boot off a network
server using a boot PROM compatible with the Intel PXE (Pre-Execution
Environment) specification, ISOLINUX, a program to boot off ISO 9660
CD-ROMs in native mode, and MEMDISK, a tool to boot legacy operating
systems (e.g. DOS) using a Linux boot loader regardless of medium.

Changes: This prerelease is available to test out a rewrite of some of the
internals. This will make it possible to support multiple ramfs input files
in the future, using the Linux 2.5 "initramfs" protocol.

[001] - 3dDesktop 0.1.2
  by Brad Wasson (http://freshmeat.net/users/bwasson/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 15:26

Desktop Environment Desktop Environment :: Gnome

About: 3d Destkop is an OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops in a
seamless 3-dimensional manner. The current desktop is mapped into a 3D
space where you may choose other screens. Several different visualization
modes are available.  

Changes: Compile time OpenGL detection has been switched to ac_opengl.  CPU
hogging has been reduced.  A semaphore has been added to avoid more then
one instance running at a time. A "Carousel" mode has been added, and it is
the default. The texture for digit 10 is now showing.  A flag to specify
the delay for random movements has been added.

[002] - AutoRPM 2.5
  by Kirk Bauer (http://freshmeat.net/users/kirkbauer/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 04:16

System :: Archiving :: Packaging System :: Software Distribution System ::
Software Distribution Tools

About: AutoRPM is a program that can do any combination  of the following:
mirror RPMs from an FTP site, keep  installed RPMs consistent with an FTP
site or local  directory and keep installed RPMs in a cluster or  network
of systems consistent. It is highly flexible  and contains a fully
command-line driven  interactive install mode (for installing RPMs from the
 queue or for installing RPMs from your system  interactively). It also
handles recursive  dependencies. 

Changes: Dependency following (within interactive queues), consistent
architecture handling, the ability to handle multiple remote versions of
RPMs correctly, and bugfixes were added.

[003] - AutoUpdate 3.5.3
  by Gerald Teschl (http://freshmeat.net/users/gtesiacat/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 13:39

System :: Archiving :: Packaging System :: Systems Administration

About: AutoUpdate is a simple Perl script which performs a task similar to
Red Hat's up2date or autorpm. It can be used to automatically download and
upgrade RPMs from different FTP sites. Moreover, it can also be used to
keep a server with a customized (Red Hat) distribution plus all clients up
to date.

Changes: Autoupdate should work under older Perl versions again.

[004] - bash programmable completion 20020402
  by Ian Macdonald (http://freshmeat.net/users/ianmacd/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 06:23

System :: Shells Utilities

About: Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and
extend its standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines
with just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to
complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3 str
[Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX
manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems
from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all targets
in Makefile. This project was conceived to produce programmable completion
routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of
typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis. 

Changes: Long option completion for netstat was added, as was renice(8)
completion. A bug in dpkg-reconfigure completion was fixed. sudo and other
commands that perform command completion now perform correctly when
wildcards in their parameters are expanded. 'cvs commit' now defaults to
local file completion instead of remote repository completion. Remote
completion errors in scp completion are now silently discarded.

About: Bauk HTTP server features virtual hosts, URL alias, CGI script
execution, GET and POST request methods, directory browsing, server host
name alias, access restriction by IP address, multiprocess organization, a
simple configuration method, flexibility, simplicity and logic, and more.

  by Brian Nelson (http://freshmeat.net/users/notgod/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 00:13

Database :: Front-Ends Software Development :: Bug Tracking

About: BugIn' is a PHP4/ADODB-powered (MySQL tested) bug/issue tracking
database. It is intended to be powerful, but lightweight enough that it
doesn't need constant maintenance. It features easy
configuration/customization of variables through the DB, an ACL system to
see/modify tickets, and ticket notification through email. 

Changes: A new ACL system, security enhancements, ADODB database
abstraction, and a whole slew of bugfixes.

  by Allan Engelhardt (http://freshmeat.net/users/cybaea/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 13:39

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Text Processing :: Markup :: XML

About: Business::Associates is a library to handle the XML interface for
the Amazon.com Associates program.  It replaces the Amazon Recommends links
to provide a powerful and simple-to-use interface that allows you to embed
complex, highly targeted ads on your Web site (or other documents).  It
supports many new features that are not available with the standard
interfaces (e.g., multi-mode searches--the ability to search across
multiple product categories).

[008] - ccache 1.4
  by tridge (http://freshmeat.net/users/tridge/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 05:56

Software Development :: Compilers

About: ccache is a fast compiler cache. It is used as a front end to your
compiler to safely cache compilation output. When the same code is compiled
again the cached output is used giving a significant speedup (typically
5x). 

Changes: This version adds a 3 level cache hierarchy, a better statistics
display, and several minor bugfixes.

[009] - Cfour 1.0 beta4 (CFfile class)
  by Jeffrey Bakker (http://freshmeat.net/users/staeryatz/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 03:16

Software Development

About: Cfour provides C++ Common Console Classes that  are reusable, for
console I/O, _easy_ file I/O, and a  class for managing configuration files
using an XML  style format. Cfour currently remains OS  independent. The
Cfour classes were used in parts  of webcpp and mkscs. 

Changes: The overloaded insertion and extraction operators can now handle
multiple streams through one call. An openW() method that never (or always)
overwrites rather than prompting, an rfile() method that reads the open
file into a string, get and set file pointer methods, and defined file open
modes were added. All templated methods are now implemented in the header
to avoid linker errors with the Microsoft compiler.

[010] - CyberBrau 0.9.3
  by Cyberbrau (http://freshmeat.net/users/baskettexp/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 18:29

Games/Entertainment Other/Nonlisted Topic Scientific/Engineering ::
Chemistry

About: Cyberbrau is a Web-based program to help the homebrewer. It allows
for very simple and intuitive beer, cider, and mead recipe creation, and it
automatically calculates all the pertinent information based on the
selected ingredients and schedule. In addition to the recipes, it allows
multiple brewers to privately track their own batches, emailing them on
racking, bottling, and lagering dates. Finally, it has a 'taster's review'
section which allows those who try your brew to rate and comment on the
batch. This information goes into the overall recipe ranking.  

Changes: Many new bugfixes and ergonomic enhancements, a few security
fixes, inclusion of a new, optional BBS to mimic www.cyberbrau.org's
functionality, a new admin section to create/admin all the beer styles,
user accounts, etc., and many little improvements all around.

  by Ander (http://freshmeat.net/users/ander/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 18:32

Text Editors :: Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

About: David is a C/C++ code editor for GNOME. It pretends to be a
complement to Glade, so it doesn't include an environment for GUI's
development. It has neither a debugger or other kind of tool to help
debugging. The idea is for it to be a light code editor that doesn't need
too many resources, and makes use of external tools (gcc, glade, ddd, etc.)
for some tasks. 

Changes: New functionality to the functions tag, a new combo functions
list, changing the messages shown when executing make, a new menu launcher
for Memprof, a new option to link with electric-fence, a menu launcher for
the project's binary, modifications to use and generate configure.in, new
tags in almost everything, modifying configure.in to be more portable,
completion of the icon set, and some bugfixes.

About: Elvin is a publish-subscribe notification and messaging service.
Message consumers use content-based subscriptions to request delivery of
structured messages. The Elvin4 server daemon has a modular architecture
with support for TCP, UDP and HTTP transports, SSL security and XDR or XML
message marshalling. It has been used for such tasks as instant messaging,
workflow, distributed gaming, network management, application integration
and as an infrastructure for computer supported cooperative work.

Changes: Several bugfixes and updates for elvin failover were added. Bugs
that would crash the server while under heavy load in a federation link or
that would prevent failover from working if clustering was not compiled in
were fixed. Multiple federation links with the one link class can now be
configured in elvind.conf.

[037] - Infinite Monkey - Native Java SecureRandom 1.0

Security Security :: Cryptography Software Development :: Libraries :: Java
Libraries

About: Infinite Monkey - Native Java SecureRandom is an   implementation of
a Java SecureRandom provider.  The default implementation of SecureRandom
in  most  JDKs spins up an enormous number of  threads and  uses that to
seed the random number  generator,  taking quite some time. Infinite 
Monkey - Native  Java SecureRandom skips the  lengthy non-native  seeding
process by letting the  underlying operating  system provide the 
randomness. Under Windows this is done through a  call to the CryptoAPI
using JNI, and under UNIX the  randomness is fetched from /dev/urandom.

Library part of the JDK 1.4. This streamlined the whole shebang.
Additionally, the function plotter was partially redesigned to use a real
Java expression parser, which speeds things up a bit.  Some small changes
were made in the API.

which should suffice for most applications. GIF encoding has been removed
due to licensing problems.  In any other regards, this branch is completely

Security :: Cryptography System :: Networking

About: The SLAN project is focused on developing a flexible open source
Virutal Private Networking system, primarily for securing Internet uplinks
which use broadcast media such as 802.11 wireless links or public/shared
ethernets. The system is flexible enough to support traditional VPN
applications as well. As well as featuring an open design and strong
security, the SLAN project hopes to eventually provide support for all
major computing platforms.  

Changes: A design change from a layer 3 tunneling protocol to layer 2,
allowing the server to join its virtual network clients to the LAN with a
bridge instead of using routing or network address translation, replacing
the buggy SLAN kernel driver with the Universal TUN/TAP driver that is
typically included in Linux-2.4 kernel, a rewrite for the control channel
TCP code, several bugfixes and code cleanups, and temporary removal of
Windows support code.

GUI (useful if you want it to use it with your .xinitrc). It uses the
smartcard program to interact with the chipdrive.  

Changes: Asking before overwriting a already existing identity, trying to
guess the smartcard's size, wiping the identity instead of just unlinking
it, and fixes for some small bugs.

Internet :: Log Analysis Internet :: WWW/HTTP Internet :: WWW/HTTP ::
Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: TestMaker tests Web Services (HTTP, HTTP, SOAP, .NET, etc.) for
functionality, scalability, and performance. TestMaker is used to develop
intelligent agents which drive a Web service just like a real user to check
system configuration and to as simulate real-world environments where heavy
load from users or virus attacks can potentially bring down a Web service.
It includes a scripting language to create the intelligent test agents, a
test object library for simulating user actions, a graphical interface for
creating and editing agents, and a utility to run agents concurrently. 

Changes: New example test agents show how to do HTTP Post commands, agents
run in threads concurrently, inclusion of Python library modules, and the
Test Object Oriented Library (Tool) is much enhanced. The new version of
Tool fixes simple authorization handling, adds support for cookies on
redirect pages, fixes URL parsing, adds custom serializer/deserializer to
be used with SOAP protocol handlers, reworks the Queue utility class to be
thread safe, and adds many new features that will support the upcoming
Agent Wizard function.

[102] - Wellenreiter 0.9
  by Max Moser (http://freshmeat.net/users/max1111/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 05:55

Communications Internet Security

About: Wellenreiter is a GTK/Perl program that makes the discovery and
auditing of 802.11b wireless networks much easier. It has an embedded
statistics engine for the common parameters provided by wireless drivers,
enabling you to view details about the consistency and signal strength of
the network. Its scanner window can be used to discover access-points,
networks, and ad-hoc cards. It detects essid broadcasting or
non-broadcasting networks in every channel, the manufacturer, WEP, and
automatically-switching frequencies. A flexible sound event configuration
lets you work in unattended environments. A logwindow helps to track the
net scanning. A ethereal / tcpdump compatible dumpfile can be created for
the whole session, so detailed analysis at another location is easy.
Wellenreiter can reside on low-resolution devices that can run GTK/Perl and
Linux/BSD (such as iPaqs).

Changes: The ability to add, edit and delete custom comments for each
accesspoint, a popup menu with the detailview of an accesspoint, an
accoustic_events subroutine, dumpfile support allowing you to dump your
whole scan to a pcap dumpfile, support for disabling automatic
channelswitching, modifications to the default startsniff command, and a
new log window that makes it more easier to track the timeline were added.
The "detected by Frametype" accesspoints detail view was removed. All
capture 802.11b frames are now dumped. The the manufacturer detection was
corrected.

[005] - AutoUpdate 3.7
  by Gerald Teschl (http://freshmeat.net/users/gtesiacat/)
  Friday, April 19th 2002 14:33

System :: Archiving :: Packaging System :: Systems Administration

About: AutoUpdate is a simple Perl script which performs a task similar to
Red Hat's up2date or autorpm. It can be used to automatically download and
upgrade RPMs from different FTP sites. Moreover, it can also be used to
keep a server with a customized (Red Hat) distribution plus all clients up
to date.

Changes: This release adds support for optionally using the Perl LWP
module. In particular, this implies better proxy support and native HTTPS
support for autoupdate. In order to use it, install LWP (plus Crypt::SSLeay
for HTTPS) and set UseLWP=1.  In addition, some bugs were fixed.

[006] - BKFTP 0.2
  by Klasa (http://freshmeat.net/users/klasa/)
  Friday, April 19th 2002 11:35

Internet :: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

About: BKFTP was written to overcome shortcomingsin  existing GTK+ FTP
clients. It is written for people  who need easy access to the FTP command
line  and a minimalistic graphic UI. The program presents  as few options
as possible to the user while  maintaining flawless operation. Advanced
functions  are still available to users that are familiar with the  FTP
protocol. It also supports FXP.

Changes: Some bugs that made the client timeout unnecessarily were fixed. A
bug in the terminal that forced autoscrolling was fixed. The terminal has
an upper size limit of 4000 chars. A slew of usability improvements were
made. Most notably, RETURN can be used to enter directories in a file
listing, to give file navigation much better keyboard support.

  Friday, April 19th 2002 04:49

Communications :: Email :: Mailing List Servers Internet :: WWW/HTTP

About: PHPlist is a set of PHP pages that implement a simple mailinglist
system. It uses Mysql for storing the information. Particular aspects of
the system include posting to the mailinglist via a webpage. It is thus a
kind of "announcements" list. It can deal with a very large email address
lists. Users can sign up to multiple lists. If a message is sent to
multiple lists, they will only receive one copy of the email and not as
many as the number of lists they are subscribed to. Geographical
information. If people sign up, they can identify the geographical location
they're in allowing messages to be sent only to a subset of these.

Changes: This version features many bugfixes, particularly in the HTML
email sending part. PHPlist is now more configurable via the admin pages,
which makes it easier to install. The upgrade has improved dramatically,
and will allow for a smooth upgrade from any 1.3.X version to this one and
future ones. Anyone using a previous version is strongly advised to upgrade
to this version.

technology. "Compiler" focuses on Tcl and C, but has been constructed in a
manner that facilitates the addition of other languages.

Changes: In this version, bugs in the Meta2C, Tcl2Meta, and core have been
fixed, including bugs with "cct rep --init". Additional Tcl/Tk prototypes
were added into the repository, the syntax for the REPOSITORY keyword was
changed, and the repository is now stored in ~/.cct/repository.

About: WLA DX is yet another macro assembler that can program the GB-Z80,
Z80, 6502, 6510, 65816, and SPC-700 CPUs. Included in the package there is
a GB-Z80 disassembler and few converters. WLA DX was initially programmed
to compile ROM images for Gameboy, but nowadays it can also patch existing
ROM images with code, and even compile program files and ROM files for
other CPUs like the NES-6502, C64-6510, and SNES's SPC-700.

Changes: All unidentified free strings were treated as labels. Now labels
can only start at the beginning of a new line. Support for yet another
un-named label (__) has been added. ".endm" also works (only ".ENDM" used
to work). The preprocessor has been fixed to work better. .DxSIN and .DxCOS
finally work properly. The 'x' switch also generates WLA_VERSION. The
preprocessor can handle a few special cases related to the use of '+'. WLA
can also be given hints about the operand size with .b and .w in the
operand (e.g. "and 10.w").

Security Security :: Cryptography Software Development

About: XML Security Library is a C library based on LibXML2 and OpenSSL.
The library was created with a goal to support major XML security
standards: XML Signature and XML Encryption.    

Changes: This minor release was made to fix a broken RPM.  This version has
been recompiled using OpenSSL 0.9.6.  The previous version was compiled
with OpenSSL 0.9.7, but there were complaints that there are no RPMs for
0.9.7 yet.  The downsides of using 0.9.6 are some functionality limitations
for XML Encryption (no AES support, incorrect padding mode for DES, etc.). 
If you want to use XML Encryption, it is better to compile the library from
sources and use OpenSSL 0.9.7. The testDSig, testEnc, and testKeys scripts
have merged into a standalone "xmlsec" application.  A couple of minor bugs
have been fixed.

[007] - BlackHole Spam/Virus Filter 0.9.82 (Stable)
  by Chris Kennedy (http://freshmeat.net/users/getdown/)
  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 18:16

Communications :: Email Communications :: Email :: Filters Security

About: Blackhole Spam/Virus Filter provides multiple spam blocking
techniques, "white list" features, and flexible storage of blocked email.
It can check for bad email addresses/domains, bad email relays/networks,
bad subject lines, allowed charsets, ASCII sets greater than 128 (non-Latin
charsets), RBL lists, Razor, the SpamAssassin body check/scoring system,
custom body checking phrases, sender DNS, and relay reverse DNS. It tags
spam and viruses with X-BlackHole-* headers that explain why the message
was blocked. Each check can have separate actions if the message matches.
Custom header and body checks give you full control of every aspect of the
emails contents, and the scoring/actions system is flexible, allowing many
ways of setting up the checks to give each unique consequences. 

Changes: This release adds the ability to forward email blocked as
spam/viruses and email that is ok to different email addresses, local or
remote. It does this using an SMTP relay you specify (defaults to
127.0.0.1). You can change the .Spam and .Virus maildir names at build
time. A problem with Postfix and reading the config file has been fixed.
spam_fwd has been added to the possible individual actions for each check.
127.0.0.1 is in the list of my_relays by default.

[009] - Cooperative Content Acceleration 1.68
  by cogitive (http://freshmeat.net/users/cogitive/)
  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 02:59

Internet :: WWW/HTTP System :: Clustering/Distributed Networks

About: CCA makes it possible for Web servers to increase   their perceived
performance by dynamically   distributing content across a global network
of   cooperating servers. It uses resources on non- origin servers only as
needed. Unlike replication  systems, traffic is not distributed to the
replication  caches at all times, obviating the need to predict  future
load conditions. CCA also automatically  removes data from and stops
directing traffic to  non-origin servers when the number of requests for 
that data subside.  

Changes: This release changes the CCAFilter directive to accept one
argument only, as the second argument was unnecessary.

  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 02:50

System :: Hardware Utilities

About: fbmodes is a display mode generator. Give it your desired screen
resolution and refresh rate, and the program gives you a working display
mode. Optionally you can tell the wanted horizontal and vertical sync
lengths and invisible area sizes to finetune the mode. The package contains
actually two programs. One of them just does the math, and another actually
testes the mode showing some graphics to measure how much the mode needs to
be corrected. 

Changes: This version reorganizes the source code so that in the future,
fbmodes won't have to depend on the framebuffer console.

[020] - flap mail user agent 0.3
  by Maik Schreiber (http://freshmeat.net/users/blizzy/)
  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 17:05

Communications :: Email :: Email Clients (MUA)

About: flap is a mail user agent written in pure Java. Its  main
distinctive feature is mounting message  folders (like POP3 or IMAP) into a
virtual folder tree,  just like in Unix. Other features are a full-featured
 macro language (using BeanShell) and an  extensive filter rule set.

Changes: This release has switched to XML for storing the options, has
overall speed improvements (especially for IMAP), and a context menu for
the message table to delete messages. The folder tree shows the number of
unread messages and updates itself when new messages arrive. Windows and
sliders now remember their positions and dimensions. Important messages are
displayed in red. Recipients are inserted automatically when replying to
messages. Multiple recipients are allowed. "reply to all", "reply to list",
and forwarding have been implemented. At least Java 1.4 is required.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Software Development :: Libraries
:: Application Frameworks Software Development :: Libraries :: Java
Libraries

About: FreeMarker allows Java servlets to keep graphic design separate from
application logic, by encapsulating HTML in templates. Templates generate
HTML dynamically, using data provided by the servlet. The template language
is powerful and intuitive, the compiler is fast, and the output approaches
the speed of static HTML pages.

Changes: The core parsing/rendering engine now generates much more
informative error messages. Stack traces now include the line and column
number where an error occurred in the template. The layout of the
documentation has been improved, and it no longer uses frames. A Velocity
to FreeMarker automatic template conversion utility is also available. Note
that FreeMarker 2.x (Lazarus) is a rewrite of the well-known FreeMarker
template engine. It has many new features, such as full support for both
integer and floating point arithmetic.

  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 10:05

Desktop Environment :: Fonts

About: FreeType 2 is a high-quality and portable font engine that is
capable of supporting several font formats (be they bitmapped or scalable)
through a simple and uniform interface. Its design is modular and allows
independent "font driver" modules to be added, even at runtime, to support
additional formats. It also provides a high-quality anti-aliasing renderer,
an innovative auto-hinting engine, and support for the following font
formats: TrueType Type1, CID-Type 1, Multiple Masters Type 1 OpenType/CFF,
pure CFF, and CEF Windows FNT/FON.

Changes: The TrueType bytecode interpreter has been fixed to produce
exactly the same output as FreeType 1.x. The parsing of accelerator tables
in the PCF font driver was fixed. The Type1 glyph loader routine used to
compute the font's maximum advance width was fixed.

[029] - Gringotts 0.4.4
  by Germano Rizzo (http://freshmeat.net/users/mano78/)
  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 05:28

Desktop Environment :: Gnome Security Security :: Cryptography

About: Gringotts is a small utility that allows you to jot down sensitive
data (passwords, credit card numbers, PINs, etc.) in an easy-to-read,
easy-to-access, and most of all very secure form. Gringotts makes use of
the MCrypt and MHash libraries for encryption, and uses GTK+ 2 for the user
interface. It lets the user choose from among eight strong encryption
algorithms (RIJNDAEL-128, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT, TWOFISH, CAST-256, SAFER+,
LOKI97, 3DES), two hashing algorithms (SHA1, RIPEMD 160) and two
compression techniques (ZLib and BZip2) with four compression ratios.
Moreover, it allows the user to use any file as a password, as an
alternative to the usual plain-text file, improving security one step
further.

Changes: This version introduces a new major feature, the possibility to
use a file as a password (use with care, it's still in testing). Moreover,
many changes have been made to the code to make it more optimized and
modular, and a new security improvement has been introduced, too. Finally,
Italian and French translations have been updated.

  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 16:12

Internet System :: Networking

About: jwhois is an Internet Whois client that contains an extensible
configuration file, which defines its operation. The client supports
queries to foreign hosts, either through the RFC 954 - NICNAME/WHOIS
protocol, the RFC 2167 - Referral Whois 1.5 protocol, or HTTP using an
external browser. Upon execution, it searches through its configuration to
find the most specific whois server to query. Depending upon the reply from
that whois server, it can assume the query was successfull and display the
result to the user, or optionally redirect the query to another server to
find more specific information. 

Changes: More advanced rewrites of queries (targeted for more picky HTTP
servers), and updating the example configuration to list even more domains.

  by Alexandre Cassen (http://freshmeat.net/users/acassen/)
  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 18:14

Internet System System :: Clustering/Distributed Networks

About: Keepalived for LVS aims to add a strong and robust keepalive
facility to the Linux Virtual Server project. This project is written in C
with multilayer TCP/IP stack checks. It implements a framework based on
three family checks: Layer3, Layer4, and Layer5. This framework gives the
daemon the ability of checking a LVS server pool states.When one of the
servers in the LVS server pool is down, keepalived informs the Linux kernel
via a setsockopt call to remove this server entry from the LVS topology. In
addition, it implements a VRRPv2 stack to handle director failover. 

Changes: Autoconf/automake scripts have been reviewed to permit framework
compiling selection. An SSL stream handling bug and some issues in the
configuration file parser have been fixed. The maximum number of VRRP VIPs
is limited to 20 per VRRP Instance. IPVS wrapper framework support has been
added to the persistence granularity mask. Support has been added to SMTP
notification for VRRP MASTER state transition. UserGuide.pdf has been
fixed.

  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 16:09

System :: Systems Administration

About: Linux Security Auditing Tool (LSAT) is a post install security
auditing tool. It is modular  in design, so new features can be added

appends header and/or tempfile to outfile (all modules now use dostuff), a
fix for checkinetd which broke under Linux 2.4, LSAT cleans up tmp files,
reports error and keeps going if any module fails, a new section in
README.modules on module writing, addition of missing modules, cleanups to
the output format, and fixes for verbose messages.

[059] - Mice 4.1
  by Alan Clifford (http://freshmeat.net/users/AlanClifford/)
  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 20:17

About: Mice (Mundungus Internet Connection Enhancer) is a server designed
for a home network where one machine has a modem to connect to the
Internet. Clients on other machines can communicate with the server and ask
it to connect to the Internet. The server keeps track of client requests
and disconnects when all clients no longer require connection. Mice server
does not connect to the Internet itself--it relies on programs such as pppd
to do that. An example set-up using pppd is supplied. 

Changes: Only the Java client and documentation have been changed. The name
of the server to contact can be set in the client's GUI as well as on the
commandline. The Java client runs on the Psion 5mx, and a .app file is

  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 17:07

Security System :: Operating System Kernels :: Linux

About: NSA Security-enhanced Linux is a set of patches to the Linux kernel
and some utilities to incorporate a strong, flexible mandatory access
control architecture into the major subsystems of the kernel. It provides a
mechanism to enforce the separation of information based on confidentiality
and integrity requirements, which allows threats of tampering and bypassing
of application security mechanisms to be addressed and enables the
confinement of damage that can be caused by malicious or flawed
applications. It includes a set of sample security policy configuration
files designed to meet common, general-purpose security goals.

Changes: Two new technical reports are available in the documentation: a
document describing the policy language and a document describing the
current LSM implementation of SELinux. The stable (2.4) LSM-based SELinux
prototype remains at kernel 2.4.18. The development (2.5) LSM-based SELinux
prototype was updated to kernel 2.5.10. A number of policy improvements,
minor feature enhancements, and bugfixes have also been made.

[076] - Port Scan Attack Detector 0.9.8
  by Michael Rash (http://freshmeat.net/users/michaelrash/)
  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 10:35

System :: Networking :: Firewalls System :: Networking :: Monitoring

About: Port Scan Attack Detector (psad) is a program written in Perl that
is designed to work with Linux firewalling code (iptables in the 2.4.x
kernels, and ipchains in the 2.2.x kernels) to detect port scans. It
features a set of highly configurable danger thresholds (with sensible
defaults provided), verbose alert messages that include the source,
destination, scanned port range, begin and end times, TCP flags and
corresponding nmap options (Linux 2.4.x kernels only), email alerting, and
automatic blocking of offending IP addresses via dynamic configuration of
ipchains/iptables firewall rulesets. In addition, for the 2.4.x kernels
psad incorporates many of the TCP signatures included in Snort to detect
highly suspect scans for various backdoor programs (e.g. EvilFTP,
GirlFriend, SubSeven), DDoS tools (mstream, shaft), and advanced port scans
(syn, fin, Xmas) which are easily leveraged against a machine via nmap. 

Changes: The configuration architecture was changed by making all four psad
daemons reference the same configuration file (/etc/psad/psad.conf).
Psad::builconf() and Psad::validate_config() were added. TCP wrapper
support was added in the auto-blocking code. A better install strategy is
now used for psadfifo in /etc/syslog.conf. The main psad code was
simplified by removing all references to the Scan hash and by shortening
some of the function calls.

About: Pysync has both a demonstration implementation of the rsync
algorithm in pure Python, and a high speed librsync Python extension. The
pure Python is not fast and is not optimized, however it does work and
provides a simple implementation of the algorithm for reference and
experimentation. It includes a combination of ideas taken from librsync,
xdelta, and rsync. The librsync Python extension is less flexible and
harder to understand, but is very fast.

Changes: Be warned that the API and data format have been changed in ways
that are not backwards compatible. A high speed librsync swig extension
module was added. An MD4 extension module was added. The API was changed to
be more like librsync/rdiff. distutils is now used to build releases for
Linux and Windows.

  Thursday, May 2nd 2002 10:50

Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: The milter module for Python provides a python interface to
Sendmail's libmilter that exploits all its features.   Milters can run on
the same machine as sendmail, or another machine. The milter can even run
with a different operating system or processor than sendmail. Sendmail
talks to the milter via a local or internet socket, and keeps the milter
informed of events as it processes a mail connection. At any point, the
milter can cut the conversation short by telling sendmail to ACCEPT,
REJECT, or DISCARD the message. After receiving a complete message from
sendmail, the milter can again REJECT or DISCARD it, but it can also ACCEPT
it with changes to the headers or body.

Changes: The MIME module can now parse HTML and remove scripts. Defang now
checks whether any Content-Type attribute has a Windows executable
extension, not just the name. This kills the Klez virus.

return 404 and 403 response codes when applicable. A RootTitle macro was

extensible. The user management system was completely rebuilt, using the
new profile, user, and form packages. User preferences were added for date
format, time format, and time offset, and a few tiny bugs were fixed.

The Book of Linux Music and Sound
by jeff covey (http://freshmeat.net/~jeffcovey/)
Section: Book Reviews
Saturday, May 18th 2002 00:00

Musicians aren't always technically inclined. When they look for music
software to run on their computers, they're apt to buy something for the
Windows system they already have or believe the advice that anything
artistic is supposed to be done an a Mac. Linux systems provide cheap and
powerful alternatives, and this book tells you how to get started with
them.

[004] - Bubbling Load Monitor Applet 1.2.0
  by Walles (http://freshmeat.net/users/walles/)
  Saturday, May 18th 2002 10:57

Desktop Environment :: Gnome Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: The Bubbling Load Monitor (or "Bubblemon" for short) is a system CPU
and memory load monitor for the GNOME panel. It looks like a vial
containing water. The water level indicates how much (electronic) memory is
in use. The color of the liquid indicates how much swap space is used. The
amount of bubbles reflects the system CPU load.

Changes: Portability between desktop environments has been much improved by
separating the sources into platform-dependent and platform-independent
files. The GNOME port has been rewritten from scratch, which should solve
all reported display problems.

  by Ben Martin (http://freshmeat.net/users/monkeyiq/)
  Saturday, May 18th 2002 22:35

Software Development :: Libraries System :: Filesystems

About: libferris is a virtual filesystem that exposes hierarchical data of
all kinds through a common C++ interface. Access to data is performed using
C++ IOStreams and Extended Attributes (EA) can be attached to each datum to
present metadata. Ferris uses a plugin API to read various data sources and
expose them as contexts and to generate interesting EA. Current
implementations include Native (kernel disk IO with event updates using
fam), xml (mount an xml file as a filesystem), edb (mount a berkeley
database), ffilter (mount an LDAP filter string) and mbox (mount your
mailbox). EA generators include image, audio, and animation decoders. 

Changes: A fix for a too-high reference count for IOStreams, calling read()
on a context keeps stateful EA attached, a new CursorAPI for maintaining a
cursor on a collection of subcontexts, a new ClipAPI for file-clipboard://
actions with cursor support and undo/redo capability, and new clients for
ClipAPI (fclipcopy, fclipcut, fclippaste, fclipredo, and fclipundo). Note
that the file-clipboard:// history can also be mounted as a filesystem.

About: OpenCL is a library of cryptographic algorithms, written in C++. It
currently includes a wide selection of block and stream ciphers, public key
algorithms, hash functions, and message authentication codes, plus a high
level filter-based interface.

new features. The SHA2-384 hash function has been added, as has an
(experimental) algorithm lookup API. Adler32 and SHA2-512 have seen major
speedups, and bugs were fixed in BufferingFilter and the X9.19 message
authentication code.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content

About: php_jh_pdf is a set of classes intended to simplify the generation
of PDF documents with PHP. It enables you to put down continuous text with
automatic line wrapping, automatic creation of new pages, etc. It also
renders barcodes directly onto the PDF document. It offers classes for
creating tables by only specifying column widths and the data to put into
the cells. The table layout (border widths, colors) is highly adjustable.
The table class builds on top of the other classes, so table cells can
contain anything supported by the other php_jh_pdf classes. The interface
used by the table class to output the actual content is simple and classes
for putting in other content can thus be easily created.  

Changes: Support for barcode type 128a/b/c was added. Support for static
row heights was added. Support for clipping to cell area was added. An
example for printing fixed-size labels was added.

About: PLP is yet another Perl embedder, primarily for HTML documents.
Unlike with other Perl embedders, there is no need to learn a meta-syntax
or object model: one can just use the normal Perl constructs. PLP runs
under mod_perl for speeds comparable to those of PHP, but can also be run
as a CGI script.

Changes: This release adds a standardized module distribution (to allow
easy distribution via CPAN), comments for PLP hackers in PLP.pm, mod_perl
handler() for extremely easy installation, and some documentation (perldoc
PLP) with installation instructions. All the code has moved from plp.cgi to
PLP.pm.

  Saturday, May 18th 2002 06:11

Software Development

About: wingS is a servlet development framework for Web applications. It
features Swing-like components and utilizes Swing models, Swing events, and
a very similar API. A special LayoutManager allows you to place components
using designer provided HTML templates. The HTML code generation of the
components themself supports PLAF (Pluggable Look and Feel), so it is
possible to create a different output, like plain HTML, HTML+CSS, and WML.

Changes: The API has been stabilized so that no more API changes are
expected before 1.0 final release. Rendering has been improved in a way
that allows more HTML-Attributes to be set programatically or from the
template layout. With a factory pattern, you can create PLAF (Pluggable
Look and Feel) and output encodings (such as gzipped output streams) on
demand, depending on the browser. Many bugs have also been fixed.

  Sunday, May 26th 2002 18:40

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Analysis Multimedia
:: Sound/Audio :: Speech

About: eXtace is a visual sound display/analysis program. It requires ALSA
(0.5.x) loopback or Esound (esd) for its audio source. It includes various
fast fourier transforms of the audio data in realtime. Its displays include
a 3D wireframe flying landscape, a 3D textured flying landscape, a 16-256
channel graphic EQ, three types of scopes, a 3D "spike" flying landscape,
and two forms of spectragrams. The 3D traces can be picked up, manipulated,
and displayed at nearly any angle. eXtace also features a 3D direction
control widget for controlling the angle and speed at which the trace runs
away and a gradient/colormap editor for changing the colormap to suit your
needs. No OpenGL is required.

of Autoconf/Automake, as well as numerous small bugfixes. Users are
recommended to remove their ~/.eXtace/config files if they experience odd
behavior before submitting a bug report. An ALSA 0.5 precompiled version is
no longer available. The code is still there, you just have to build it
yourself from the source RPM or tarball.

[028] - HTML::TextToHTML 0.03
  by Kathryn Andersen (http://freshmeat.net/users/kat/)
  Sunday, May 26th 2002 09:00

Text Processing :: Markup :: HTML

About: HTML::TextToHTML converts plain text files into HTML. It supports
headings, tables, lists, simple character markup, and hyperlinking, and is
highly customizable. It recognizes some of the apparent structure of the
source document (mostly whitespace and typographic layout), and attempts to
mark that structure explicitly using HTML. This Perl module can be used
inside Perl scripts or called from the commandline, making it versatile and
easy to use.

Changes: HTML::TextToHTML now supports tables. The table-parsing was taken
from Gareth Rees's HTML::FromText module. Various rewriting was done to
support this. As a result, an additional method, process_para, enables one
to process a passed-in string, not just a file. The documentation was
improved. The do_help method was added and the behavior of help-related
options was changed. The --make_anchors option, which basically makes the
creation of anchors optional, was added. The sample links dictionary was
tweaked. Bold is now marked by #bold# text. Patterns now match across
multiple lines.

System :: Hardware Utilities

About: Memtest-86 is a very thorough stand-alone memory test for x86 and
Pentium systems (and compatibles). It currently does 11 tests to fully
determine whether you have faulty RAM or not.

Changes: Testing of more than 2GB of memory is finally fixed. The
infrastructure is now able to poll ECC error reporting chipset regisets,
and the support has been added for some chipsets. Dynamic relocation
information records are now used to make the program's own PIC instead of
requiring 2 copies of memtest86 in the binary. The serial console code no
longer does redundant writes to the serial port. The program is now
slightly slower at 9600 baud. Netbooting is working again. LinuxBIOS
support for getting the memory size was added. Many bugfixes and code
cleanups were done.

Communications :: Email Communications :: Email :: Mail Transport Agents
Internet

About: The main features of MEsmtpd are SMTP-Auth (RFC 2554) and rewriting
the 'From:' header ('email body From: header' and 'envelope from') based on
an account-list (configuration file and auth data). Some big companies
don't allow plain SMTP because the 'From header' (sender) is fakeable by
the sender. Many companies use MAPI (MS Exchange) to solve this problem.
The alternative open source solution is MEsmtpd. It is an independent
extension to sendmail, postfix or qmail.

Changes: This release has a bugfix for KMail 1.4 (KDE3).

virtual hosts. It  is fast and secure, uses threads, and has  been written
entirely from scratch and does not  rely on mbox or Maildir formats.

Changes: This release supports config files, empty FROM:<> (with
restrictions), maximum hop checking, aliasing with wild cards, mail bombing
protection, and multiple interface support. Important bugs were also fixed,
notably one where a 5xx error code was sent for a mailbox full error
instead of a 4xx, causing some MTAs to not try to resend later. SQL tables
were modified, but a script is provided to easily migrate databases.

Text Processing :: Markup :: HTML Text Processing :: Markup :: XML

About: NekoHTML is a simple HTML scanner and tag balancer that enables Java
application programmers to parse HTML documents and access the information
using standard XML interfaces. The parser can scan HTML files and "fix up"
many common mistakes that human (and computer) authors make in writing HTML
documents. NekoHTML is written using the Xerces Native Interface (XNI) that
is the foundation of the Xerces2 implementation. This enables application
programmers to use the NekoHTML parser with existing XNI tools without
modification or rewriting code. 

Changes: The tag balancer bug introduced in the previous version was fixed.
The scanner was modified to report malformed start elements and bare
less-than characters as text.

[086] - twin 0.4.2 (Stable)
  by Massimiliano Ghilardi (http://freshmeat.net/users/paperinik/)
  Sunday, May 26th 2002 14:26

Terminals :: Terminal Emulators/X Terminals

About: Twin is a text-mode window environment. It turns a text terminal
into a X11-style display with window manager, terminal windows, and can
also serve as display for remote applications. Each terminal window
provides the functions of a text-mode Linux console. Twin runs on the Linux
console, X11, libggi, and itself. It supports multiple simultaneous
displays, and can attach/detach each display on the fly.

Changes: This release has significant bug fixes. Some GCC extensions
lurking in the code have been removed, X11 keyboard support for 8-bit keys
was fixed, buggy libTw TwStat() was fixed, keyboard-based widget traversing
was fixed, and cut and paste in '-hw=twin' was fixed. It includes full
nested menu support, Unicode cut and paste, more libTw functions, and
hand-optimized in assembler many libTw functions. Finally, libTT and a
'ttdemo' client for it are now released, even if they still need work.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site
Management Office/Business

About: WebGUI is a platform built to allow average business users to build
and maintain complex Web sites. It is modular, pluggable, and platform
independent. It was designed to allow the people who create the content to
manage it online, rather than content management taking up the time of busy
IT Staff. Whether you are building a consumer site, an intranet, or an
extranet, WebGUI has something to offer.  

Changes: The "^Env();" macro, the "^ThumbnailLinker();" macro, a Swedish
translation, an HTML segment filter, a wobjects interface, and the magical
"Everyone" group were added. File sizes were added to the download manager.
Anti-caching meta tags are now used while in admin mode. The Real Objects
Edit-On Pro editor is now supported. The "^r;" macro was changed to allow
for a configurable style. The FAQ, Link List, Download Manager, and Events
Calendar now allow inline editing of their data. ImageMagick is now
optional. All wobjects that have collateral data now have a "proceed"
option to continue adding data, making data entry easier.

About: Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and

with just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to
complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3 str
[Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX
manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems
from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all
targets in Makefile. This project was conceived to produce programmable
completion routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the
amount of typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis. 

Changes: $BASH_COMPLETION_DIR was accidentally set to /etc/bash_completion
instead of /etc/bash_completion.d. In tar completion, completing on files
within a tar file would consume all memory in bash 2.05a, due to a known
bug in bash. This is now worked around.

Communications :: Email
Communications :: Email :: Filters
Security

About: Blackhole Spam/Virus Filter provides spam and virus filtering using
dot-files in all the major MTA/SMTP servers for UNIX and similar systems.
It is easy for an individual user to set it up with shell account access
and configure. It is different from other, similar programs, in that it
executes a minimal number of programs to do the filtering, is able to use
a MySQL database for the users' configuration files, can be set up as the
queue in Qmail, and have virtual users' configuration files be found using
the username/domain for the recipient. Multiple checks are available, and
there open options on how to treat flagged email. There is logging to
multiple entities, auto-expiration of flagged email, and scoring available
so that multiple checks require matches that add up before blocking. 

Changes: A code cleanup to allow for statistic collection for email
traffic in the future, and other minor cleanups.

About: bTemplate is a PHP class that facilitates the  separation of PHP
code and various markup  languages (HTML, XML, etc.). It provides simple 
variable interpolation, loops, complex (nested)  loops, simple
conditionals, and case loops. By  default, it uses XML compatible syntax,
but the  opening and closing tags can be customized.

Changes: This version introduces a new case loop syntax, an optional
second argument to the constructor (whether to reset template variables
after a fetch() call), and a reset_vars() method that allows you to
manually reset template variables. The documentation has been updated to
include all features, and the bTemplate Web site has benchmarks that
compare bTemplate to various other template systems.

About: Bug Traction is a Web-based bug tracking system written in Perl
with DBI. It is based on Bugtrack, but adds a number of features. It
should work in all situations where Bugtrack works, but there are features
that have been added (such as attachments) that may not yet work with any
database backend other than MySQL. In all other respects, Bug Traction is
true to the Bugtrack heritage which it shares and should work on a variety
of platforms and with a variety of database backends.

Changes: All known bugs have been fixed. The last operation report on bugs
is now displayed. Project Status editing has been restored and enhanced.
URL management and user messaging was added. Per-user configuration
options (vacation mode and bug list size) were enhanced, and users can be
marked 'assignable'. Bugs can now be marked with a target release version.
All users are encouraged to upgrade to 1.2.

Software Development
Software Development :: Quality Assurance

About: Codestriker is a Perl CGI script that is used for performing code
reviews in a collaborative fashion, as opposed to using patches sent in
unstructured emails. Authors create code review topics, and the nominated
reviewers are automatically notified by email. Reviewers can view the
proposed diff in plain text mode, coloured-diff mode, and can also view
the original and new files that comprise the review in their entirety when
Codestriker is linked with CVS. Comments are made on a per-line basis, and
comments submitted by the other reviewers can be viewed as they are
created. Emails are sent to the appropriate parties when comments are
created. The author is free to submit comments against the review
comments. The end result is a structured set of review comments instead of
a pile of unstructured emails. Codestriker also features the ability to
search over existing topics in a variety of ways.  

Changes: Codestriker has been restructured into a number of Perl modules.
Codestriker's data is now stored into a database using DBI, supporting
PostgreSQL, MySQL and other databases. It is now possible to list the
current topics in the system, and to filter by topic state. It is also
possible to search over all topics in the system, in a large number of
ways. Comments are now entered via a popup window, so that the view topic
screen is not reloaded after each comment, making reviews far more
bandwidth friendly.

About: Gringotts is a small utility that allows you to jot down sensitive
data (passwords, credit card numbers, PINs, etc.) in an easy-to-read,
easy-to-access, and most of all very secure form. Gringotts makes use of
the MCrypt and MHash libraries for encryption, and uses GTK+ 2 for the
user interface. It lets the user choose from among eight strong encryption
algorithms (RIJNDAEL-128, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT, TWOFISH, CAST-256,
SAFER+, LOKI97, 3DES), two hashing algorithms (SHA1, RIPEMD 160) and two
compression techniques (ZLib and BZip2) with four compression ratios.
Moreover, it allows the user to use any file as a password, as an
alternative to the usual text string, giving additional choices.

Changes: When an entry was repositioned via the list dialog, it overwrote
the other entries it shifted in the operation. This has been fixed.

[045] - Keso 0.3
  by Lars Luthman (http://freshmeat.net/users/larsl/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 14:20

About: Keso is an editor for scores and orchestras. Or,  more precisely, a
tracker-like GUI for the powerful  softsynth Csound. It lets the user
write music in  patterns, and arrange those patterns in sequences.  It
will produce orchestra and score files that can  be played or rendered by
Csound. The user  interface consists of different editors. Each editor  is
a plugin that can be removed or replaced, and  new editors can be added
while the program is  running. 

Changes: Almost all the code from 0.2 has been moved to a shared library,
which is used by a new GUI program (based on gtkmm). There are GUI editors
for the orchestra, the patterns, the sequences, and the ftables. It is
still a bit rough, but now it is possible to generate Csound files. There
are no instruments included in this release though.

cfg_property_type enumeration were added, ugly macros were removed, and a
working example was added to the distribution. Installation and
documentation building stuff was improved, and documentation was updated.

account, and then uses mysqldump to save the data in a subdirectory named
in the script. It then tars and gzips the files, using the date and time
for the file name. It can be run from cron on a daily basis. It removes
old files and has an option to email the gzip file to an admin, and/or FTP
the file to a remote server. It also has options to use "select data into
outfile" or a regular "select" for users who can't use mysqldump. It
supports LARGE sets of databases and tables.

statements for Net::FTP and MIME::Lite if those libraries aren't
installed), and some code and instructions have been reworked.

[072] - NeoBOPM 1.0 (Stable)
  by Justin (http://freshmeat.net/users/fishwaldo/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 11:15

Communications :: Chat :: Internet Relay Chat

About: NeoBOPM is a modified version of BOPM, which acts as a server on a
IRC network instead of a client. It scans clients for open proxies
(commonly used to attack IRC network with floodbots) as they connect to a
IRC network and will Akill the host if its an open proxy. The advantage of
running this as a server instead of as a bot is that it can scan all
connections on a network, and not just local connections. NeoBOPM scans
for open HTTP, SOCKS 4/5, and Wingate proxies as well as insecure Cisco
routers. 

Changes: This release has been fully tested with the Ultimate3.x.x series
of IRCDs, but should also work with most Bahamut-based IRCDs.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: PHP Auth is a very flexible framework for PHP applications that is
loosely based on phplib. It requires PHP4 session support. The main
difference between PHP Auth and phplib is the improved auth class.
Additionally, PHP Auth includes support for user registration and
user-level and admin-level account administration (change username,
password, etc.). It currently has support only for MySQL, however, the
database functionality is completely abstracted away from the rest of the
code, so changes for other database systems should be trivial.

[086] - PhysicsFS 0.1.6
  by icculus (http://freshmeat.net/users/icculus/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 06:17

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Filesystems

About: PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to  various
archives. The programmer defines a "write  directory" on the physical
filesystem. No file writing  done through the PhysicsFS API can leave that
 write directory, for security. For file reading, the  programmer lists
directories and archives that form  a "search path". Once the search path
is defined, it  becomes a single, transparent, hierarchical  filesystem.
This makes for easy access to ZIP files  in the same way as you access a
file directly on  the disk, and it makes it easy to ship a new archive 
that will override a previous archive on a per-file  basis. Symbolic links
can be disabled, for added  safety. Finally, PhysicsFS gives you a
platform- abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are  available, the
user's home directory, where in the  real filesystem your program is
running, etc. 

Changes: This release uses the GNU autoconf/automake build system and
includes zlib 1.1.4 with the source for platforms that need it. Also added
was an API for determining a file's last modification time and a
quick-and-dirty HTTP server to demonstrate library usage. Doxygen can now
be used to generate man pages and an HTML reference. It should now be 100%
functional on Win32, BeOS, Solaris, MacOS X, and MacOS Classic.

building RDF-driven web-sites, reusable module architecture and sample
modules (including schema-driven RDF editor module and RSS viewer module),
and the beginnings of a peer-to-peer architecture for communication
between Redfeet. 

Changes: There is now a remove and a remove_triples (no more overloaded
remove), layer 2 has been merged with layer 1 as there is no longer a need
for them to be separate layers, and the generate_uri method has moved to
LoadSave since triple stores do not have a notion of a URI. A bug was
fixed in node's n3 function, URI -> URIRef. String based exceptions were
replaced with class based exceptions, and a PyUnit test case for parser.py
was added, along with a N-Triples parser, and __len__ and __eq__ methods
to the store interface.

socket for client applications to connect to and process. Included with
this package are several Java applets for viewing your sensors live via
your favorite Web browser, a watchdog utility that will execute a user
process if and when alarm conditions occur, and a commandline client
utility useful for scripting and/or testing.

Changes: This release fixes defs for the LM87 chipset and adds support for
the adm1024 and it87 chipsets.

[100] - skadns 0.12
  by Ska (http://freshmeat.net/users/skarnet/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 04:16

Internet :: Name Service (DNS)
Software Development :: Libraries

About: skadns is an asynchronous DNS client library.  It was designed for
simplicity of use and light  resource usage, and can even be used on an 
embedded system. Unlike other DNS client  libraries, skadns leaves the
asynchronous  work to a daemon, making the client API easy  to understand
and use.

[101] - SkinLF 1.2.2
  by Frederic Lavigne (http://freshmeat.net/users/l2fprod/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 14:34

Software Development :: Libraries
Software Development :: Widget Sets

About: Todays applications tend to be skinnable: cdplayers, email
notifiers, even operating systems. SkinLF provides a skin system for Java
programs.

Changes: This release fixes an opacity bug with JLayeredPane. The shading
of InternalFrame in JDK1.4 was resizing the window to 0 pixels in height,
and JTable serialization was failing due to GtkPersonality not being
serializable. The header renderer is now in its own class, as is
GtkListCellRenderer. DefaultButton images have been made transient too.
NativeSkin replaces SkinRegion, and is not only limited to irregular
windows (the library name has changed too).

[105] - Sophie 1.38
  by Vanja Hrustic (http://freshmeat.net/users/vanja/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 06:18

Security
System

About: Sophie is a daemon which uses 'libsavi' library from Sophos anti
virus vendor ( http://www.sophos.com ). On startup, Sophie initializes
SAPI (Sophos Anti-Virus Interface), loads virus patterns into memory,
opens local UNIX domain socket, and waits for someone to connect and
instructs it which path to scan. Since the database is loaded in RAM,
scanning is very fast. (Note: speed of scanning also depends on SAVI
settings and size of the file.) It works on Linux, Solaris (Sparc/x86),
HP-UX, and FreeBSD. It was made as a part of 'Virge' project, which is a
mail/attachment/virus scanning tool, written in C.

Changes: A major bug was fixed, where -HUP would not properly restart
Sophie if the network mode was not enabled.

Python in the "special" tags. It can also be used as a commandline utility
for HTML pre-processing. 

Changes: This release has support for file uploads, request.get1(),
post1(), more reliable exception location reporting, static includes, and
a module search path.

  by H. Peter Anvin (http://freshmeat.net/users/hpa/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 02:57

System :: Boot

About: SYSLINUX is a boot loader for the Linux operating system which
operates off of MS-DOS floppies. It is intended to simplify first-time
installation of Linux, rescue disks, and other uses for boot floppies. A
SYSLINUX floppy can be manipulated using standard MS-DOS (or any other OS
that can access an MS-DOS filesystem) tools once it has been created, and
requires only a ~ 8K DOS program or ~ 16K Linux program to create it in
the first place. It also includes PXELINUX, a program to boot off a
network server using a boot PROM compatible with the Intel PXE
(Pre-Execution Environment) specification, ISOLINUX, a program to boot off
ISO 9660 CD-ROMs in native mode, and MEMDISK, a tool to boot legacy
operating systems (e.g. DOS) using a Linux boot loader regardless of
medium.

Changes: This release candidate contains additional cleanups.

Internet :: Log Analysis
Internet :: WWW/HTTP
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: TestMaker tests Web Services (HTTP, HTTP, SOAP, .NET, XML-RPC,
etc.) for functionality, scalability, and performance. TestMaker is used
to develop intelligent agents which drive a Web service just like a real
user to check system configuration and to as simulate real-world
environments where heavy load from users or virus attacks can potentially
bring down a Web service. It comes with a scripting language to create the
intelligent test agents, a test object library for simulating user
actions, a graphical interface for creating and editing agents, and a
utility to run agents concurrently.

Changes: TestMaker now supports document-style SOAP requests in addition
to SOAP RPC requests. Many new sample agents were included and a few old
agents were retired. New documentation on testing Web Services in
HTTP/HTML environments was added, and there is not much left to fix before
the final release.

[001] -  Ant8 1.4
  by urbancode sdi (http://freshmeat.net/users/urbancode/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 13:57

Internet
Software Development
Software Development :: Build Tools

About: Anthill ensures a controlled build process and promotes the sharing
of knowledge within an organization. It performs a checkout from the
source repository of the latest version of a project before every build,
and tags the repository with a unique build number after every build. It
also automatically updates a project intranet site with artifacts from the
latest build. Anthill is an extension to the Apache-Ant project and is
compatible with version 1.3 and 1.4 of Ant.

Changes: Schedules have been fixed so that the start time and build
interval can change without restarting anthill. Delete functionality has
been added to projects, schedules, and dependency groups. CVS repository
adapter problems have been fixed. The project ant parameters have been
changed; you can now call ant targets from anthill. The repository adapter
has been refactored to make it easier to plug into a non-CVS repository.
Dependency Groups have been refactored to make future changes easier. You
cannot force builds of dependent projects when building a Dependency Group
anymore.

[002] - Abbot 0.6.2
  by twall (http://freshmeat.net/users/twall/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 12:36

Software Development :: Quality Assurance
Software Development :: Testing

About: Abbot is a framework for testing Java GUIs. Using simple XML-based
scripts, you can launch a GUI, play back arbitrary user actions on it, and
examine its state. It also includes the Costello editor which facilitates
creating, debugging, and modifying scripts. The editor supports recording
arbitrary user semantic actions into a script, exploring the component
hierarchy, running the script, and other features you'd expect from a
script editor. Test scripts may be run as a JUnit TestCase.

Changes: Support has been added for auto-formatting of dialogs and
tooltips (TextFormat). The annoying drive A: bug in Win32 has been fixed.
More recorder and tester tests have been added, including a full test
suite. Launching of the GUI under test has been improved. Many Win32 event
capture/playback bugs have been fixed, especially w/r/t popups and key
capture. Component properties in the component browser are now filtered so
that it's easier to locate the more commonly-used properties.
JComponentTester now provides a scrolling action. Some editor UI
improvements were also made.

now works with register_globals=off. It is fully compatible with PHP
4.2.1, and it uses more secure DB queries. Additionally, the "send to a
friend" feature can be disabled, an improved feedback function and bug
tracker is available, and the size of the tarball was reduced. Some API
functions and modules were added.

[006] - CanIt 1.2 (Stable)
  by David F. Skoll (http://freshmeat.net/users/dskoll/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 13:20

Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: CanIt is a server-based spam-control system built around
SpamAssassin, MIMEDefang, Apache, and PostgreSQL. It features
sophisticated spam-handling techniques which minimize the amount of spam
you receive while guaranteeing that you'll never lose a valid email. CanIt
achieves extraordinarily accurate discrimination through human
intervention, and includes mechanisms to minimize the amount of human
intervention required. 

Changes: This release adds an integrated Web-based "whois" query, and a
link for generating spam-complaint emails easily. Messages can be sorted
by any field. Message dispositions can be changed even for non-pending
messages. It handles domain blacklisting and whitelisting more
intelligently (similar to Sendmail's access table.) Many small
improvements were made to the HTML presentation, which should improve the
user interface.

[007] - Clover 0.6b
  by Brendan Humphreys (http://freshmeat.net/users/brendanh/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 06:16

About: Clover makes the gathering and analysis of code coverage metrics as
painless as possible. The main features include tight integration with the
popular Jakarta Ant build tool, accurate, configurable coverage recording.
It gathers Method, Statement and Branch coverage data. Compile-time
properties and source level directives allow for precise control over the
coverage gathering process. It also allows the user to view coverage data
in XML, HTML, or via a Swing GUI. Report-time options allow for the
exclusion of particular statement types from coverage analysis. 

Changes: This version includes numerous bugfixes, and better error
reporting. Instrumentation was optimized to provide better runtime
performance, there is support for unicode identifiers, and a new Ant
property controls how Clover flushes coverage data to disk.

[009] - CRM 20020626
  by Crah the Merciless (http://freshmeat.net/users/wsymerlcom/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 10:36

Communications :: Email :: Filters
Text Processing :: Filters

About: CRM is a very powerful filtering and mutilation language based on
regex operations. It is capable of classifying mail messages, syslogs,
firewall logs, and other incoming streams of unbounded length. It has a
very powerful sparse-spectral learning capability; given examples of
multiple classes (say, business email, jokes, and spam), it can learn to
discriminate the classes. 

Changes: New features include separate submatchings for each captured
variable, much faster windowing, an explicit default window named
:_data_window_:, and latent code for auto-resizing window buffers as
needed. Examples are now more explicit and a whole slew of regression
tests are included.

System :: Filesystems
System :: Recovery Tools
System :: Systems Administration

About: e2undel is an interactive console tool that recovers the data of
deleted files on an ext2 file system under Linux. A library that allows
you to recover deleted files by name is included. e2undel does not
manipulate any internal ext2 structures, and it does not require any
additional tools. It should be useable without knowledge of the ext2
interna.

Changes: This release works with filesystem images and works better on
heavily damaged systems. It is possible that this is the last release: as
more and more people are upgrading to ext3 (or any other of the new Linux
file systems), e2undel ist getting obsolete.

[021] - FFT 1.8
  by MainNerve (http://freshmeat.net/users/mainnerve/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 20:38

About: FFT is an alternative traceroute program for  displaying the route
packets take to an IP  network host. Unlike Van Jacobson's  traceroute,
which is available on almost every  platform today, FFT uses TCP in order
to elicit  ICMP TIME_EXCEEDEDs or TCP_RST. As a  result, FFT often
executes much faster and  sees behind some configurations of packet-
filter based firewalls. 

Changes: Manual or automatic network device selection, status suppression,
and better looks when automated through a Web form. FFT is now truly a
traceroute replacement.

Security
Security :: Cryptography
System :: Logging

About: grsecurity is a complete security system for Linux 2.4 that
implements a detection/prevention/containment strategy. It prevents most
forms of address space modification, confines programs with least
privilege via its process-based ACL system, hardens syscalls, and provides
many of the OpenBSD randomness features. It has auditing capabilities and
a netfilter module designed to thwart portscans and OS fingerprinting. 

Changes: This release includes code cleanups and bugfixes, and a new
feature that protects capability-aware processes from leaking full root
privileges with execve or (f)chmod +s. Gradm, the userspace ACL
administration utility, has been updated to 1.3-rc3.

Multimedia
Multimedia :: Graphics
Multimedia :: Video

About: Veejay is a video tracking tool for X Windows  and the Linux
console, which is similar in  concept to FastTracker and ProTracker. 
Samples can be lined up on tracks and  patterns, which are then arranged

define  various types of looping, increase and  decrease playback speed,
navigate through  the effect chain, and apply entire chains of  effects in
realtime, using a joystick or keyboard.

Changes: The Effect Chain of reference samples are now built in the
current Effect Chain. For example, if 'Magic Overlay' on a sample refers
to some sample Y, the Effect Chain of sample Y will be built before
building the Effect Chain of the current sample. More Pshychodelic Plugins
have been included. A Splitted Screen Plugin was added. Maximum of samples
to create by a plugin customizable. A new effect, called 'Fade to Color',
was added. Lots of bugfixes were made.

Printing
Text Editors :: Word Processors

About: LyXDogs is a root-installable set of python scripts and shell
scripts that lets all the users on a Linux box extend the usefulness of
LyX by printing envelopes, SASEs, LyX documents (by page numbers, by
chapters, or completely), and mail-merges. LyxDogsEnvelope pulls addresses
from LyX letters to create envelopes and SASEs, and will also put an
attention line below the send-to address if you wish. LyxDogsMerge merges
a user-defined LyX-letter template with a colon-separated, user-created
text database to print letters and envelopes for a mail merge; if you use
the required patterns for directory and file names, it will also pull
pages and chapters from documents and print them during the merge.
LyxDogsPrint can be used by itself to print all or part of a LyX document
from the commandline and is used by the merge software above.

not notified, only internal users. Spam scoring above a threshold in
SpamAssassin can be labelled as "High Scoring" and handled differently
from spam below that threshold.

[060] - qGo 0.0.5 (Java)
  by Peter Strempel (http://freshmeat.net/users/pstrempel/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 08:36

Games/Entertainment

About: qGo is a Go board, SGF editor, and client for the Internet Go
Server. You can review and edit games, connect to IGS, and play against a
computer program supporting GTP (like GnuGo). Go is an ancient board game
which is very common in Japan, China, and Korea. 

Changes: This release mainly offers new features and lots of bugfixes for
the IGS client. qGo is now able to load old long format smart-game format
files. The telnet connection can now be encoded, so support for Asian
languages is possible.

[061] - rdiff-backup 0.9.2 (Development)
  by Ben Escoto (http://freshmeat.net/users/bescoto/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 18:07

System :: Archiving :: Backup
Utilities

About: rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another. The target
directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs
are stored in a special directory so you can still recover files lost some
time ago. The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an
incremental backup. rdiff-backup can also operate in a bandwidth-
efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup
and ssh to securely back up to a remote location, and only the differences
will be transmitted. It can also handle symlinks, device files,
permissions, ownership, etc., so it can be used on the entire file system.

Changes: Mainly speed increases.

[066] - SILC 0.9.3 (Server)
  by priikone (http://freshmeat.net/users/priikone/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 06:15

Communications
Communications :: Chat
Communications :: Conferencing

About: SILC (Secure Internet Live Conferencing) is a protocol which
provides secure conferencing services in the Internet over insecure
channels. SILC superficially resembles IRC, although they are very
different internally. The purpose of SILC is to provide secure
conferencing services. Strong cryptographic methods are used to secure all
traffic, and all messages are encrypted and authenticated. The SILC also
supports secure file transferring. The SILC is delivered as SILC Client
for end users, SILC Server for system administrators, and SILC Toolkit for
application developers.

Changes: This version adds preliminary backup router support for
standalone routers, with ability to work in a cell where all server does
not use the backup. This version also fixes bugs found in CMODE and JOIN
commands, CMODE_CHANGE, CUMODE_CHANGE, and TOPIC_SET notify handling.
Better support was added for reconnecting to primary router if the server
gets disconnected, and other minor bugfixes were also made.

[067] - SISC b1.5.3
  by Scott G. Miller (http://freshmeat.net/users/scgmille/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 12:49

Software Development :: Interpreters

About: SISC is an extensible Java-based interpreter of the algorithmic
language Scheme. It uses modern interpretation techniques and handily
outperforms all existing Java interpreters (often by more than an order of
magnitude). In addition, SISC is a complete implementation of the
language. The entire R5RS Scheme standard is supported, with no
exceptions. This includes a full number tower including complex number
support and arbitrary precision integers and floating point numbers,
proper tail recursion, and full support for first-class continuations (not
just escaping continuations as in many other interpreters).

Changes: Changes to serialization to allow serialization of small entities
without serializing the entire heap, reduced memory usage, improvements in
string processing speed, and minor bugfixes.

[069] - Socat 1.2.0.0 (Stable)
  by Gerhard Rieger (http://freshmeat.net/users/rieger/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 18:06

Utilities

About: Socat is a relay for bidirectional data transfer between two
independent data channels. Each of these data channels may be a file,
pipe, device (terminal or modem, etc.), socket (Unix, IP4, IP6 - raw, UDP,
TCP), etc. It provides forking, logging, and tracing, different modes for
interprocess communication, and many more options. It can be used, for
example, as a TCP relay (one-shot or daemon), as a daemon-based
socksifier, as a shell interface to Unix sockets, as an IP6 relay, for
redirecting TCP-oriented programs like brutus to a serial line, or to
establish a relatively secure environment (su and chroot) for running
client or server shell scripts with network connections. 

Changes: Two new address types are available: PTY, for generation of
pseudo terminals where applications that expect a serial line or modem can
be redirected to TCP, to a program, or to anything else supported by
socat; and experimental OPENSSL integration that allows connecting to a
listening socket that uses SSL. This implementation does not provide trust
yet. Furthermore, several minor features were added.

[070] - socklog 0.9.1
  by Gerrit Pape (http://freshmeat.net/users/pape/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 06:13

System :: Logging

About: socklog cooperates with the daemontools package to create a small
and secure replacement for syslogd. socklog supports system logging
through Unix domain sockets (/dev/log) and UDP sockets (0.0.0.0:514) with
the help of daemontools svscan, supervise, and multilog. socklog provides
a different network logging concept, and also does log event notification.
multilog has built in log file rotation based on file size, so there is no
need for any cron jobs to rotate the logs. socklog is small, secure, and
reliable.  

Changes: A bug with the optional last step of the installation
instructions (reporting success, nothing critical) introduced in the minor
source code reorganisation in 0.8.2 has been fixed in this version.

[071] - Speex 0.4.0
  by Jean-Marc (http://freshmeat.net/users/jmvalin/)
  Thursday, June 27th 2002 13:19

Communications :: Internet Phone
Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Speech

About: Speex is a patent-free compression format designed especially for
speech. It is specialized for voice communications at low bit-rates in the
8-32 kbps/channel range. Possible applications include Voice over IP
(VoIP) applications, Internet audio streaming at low bit-rate, and
archiving of speech data (e.g. voice mail).

Changes: This release adds many more bit-rates to both narrowband and
wideband, as well as the ability to change bit-rate dynamically from frame
to frame. The narrowband modes now range from 8 kbps to 18 kbps, while
wideband range from 10 kbps to 28 kbps. There is also a "noise coding"
mode at 2 kbps for narrowband and 3 kbps for wideband. All this will lead
to real Variable Bit-Rate (VBR) in the future. Also, the codec latency has
been reduced from 40 ms to 30 ms (20 ms frames + 10 ms lookahead).

[001] - Argo/UML 0.10.1
  by Thierry Lach (http://freshmeat.net/users/thierrylach/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 09:11

Text Editors :: Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

About: Argo/UML is a pure Java open source CASE tool that provides
cognitive support for object-oriented design. Argo/UML provides some of
the same editing and code generation features of a commercial CASE tool,
but it focuses on features that enhance usability and support the
cognitive needs of designers. Uses XML file formats: XMI and PGML. 

Changes: This is a bugfix release for version 0.10. The following problems
have been solved: Information about hiding of
(attribute|operation)-compartment of a class were lost during a
save-open-cycle. Deployment diagrams did not save/load properly. The
sequence diagram locked up the corresponding problem for deployment
diagrams.

Atari. 

Changes: This release features changes to the command-line options,
support for emulating 16K models, LPTjoy joystick support (Linux), man
page updates, high-speed disk I/O emulation, and an implementation of a
"Dirty" screen update scheme. 2nd joystick button support for the Atari
5200 was fixed, M68K port updates and fixes were made, and emulation for
the Trak-Ball and light gun was added. Many miscellaneous code cleanups
and bugfixes were also made.

[007] - BlackHole Spam/Virus Filter 0.9.107 (Stable)
  by Chris Kennedy (http://freshmeat.net/users/getdown/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 00:13

Communications :: Email
Communications :: Email :: Filters
Security

About: Blackhole Spam/Virus Filter provides spam and virus filtering using
dot-files in all the major MTA/SMTP servers for UNIX and similar systems.
It is easy for an individual user to set it up with shell account access
and configure. It is different from other, similar programs, in that it
executes a minimal number of programs to do the filtering, is able to use
a MySQL database for the users' configuration files, can be set up as the
queue in Qmail, and have virtual users' configuration files be found using
the username/domain for the recipient. Multiple checks are available, and
there open options on how to treat flagged email. There is logging to
multiple entities, auto-expiration of flagged email, and scoring available
so that multiple checks require matches that add up before blocking. 

Changes: String handling was improved, giving both security and
performance gains, and some double checking of strings was added in order
to avoid possible security problems.

[009] - Calculating Pi Second Release (Brute Force Method)
  by Sayan Chakraborti (http://freshmeat.net/users/sayanchak/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 09:49

Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics
Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: ProjectPi is a project to calculate the mathematical constant Pi
through various methods. 

Changes: This version uses a brute force mechanism which calculates the
area of a circle and divides it by r^2. This release completes with far
fewer iterations than the previous release, since it uses an
antidifferentiated version of the formula that computes the area. Note
that dx=1, so a radius much larger than 1 is required for good results.

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 00:32

System :: Networking
System :: Networking :: Monitoring

About: cdpr (Cisco Discovery Protocol Reporter) shows the switch and port
that a machine is connected to, provided that the device supports CDP. It
can also optionally decode the full CDP packet. cdpr was written to help
network/system administrators find out about the equipment that a machine
is connected to. This is done by capturing and decoding a Cisco Discovery
Protocol (CDP) packet. 

Changes: This release handles errors returned during packet capture
better. Older versions could segfault while trying to decode a
'non-packet'.

[011] - cdrecord 1.11a26
  by Jrg Schilling (http://freshmeat.net/users/schily/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 04:34

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: CD Audio :: CD Ripping
Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: CD Audio :: CD Writing
System :: Archiving

About: Cdrecord creates home-burned CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW recorder. It
works as a burn engine for several applications. Cdrecord supports CD
recorders from many different vendors; all SCSI-3/mmc and ATAPI/mmc
compliant drives should also work. Supported features include IDE/ATAPI,
parallel-port, and SCSI drives, audio CDs, data CDs, and mixed CDs, full
multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable), TAO, DAO and human-readable
error messages. Cdrecord includes remote SCSI support and can access local
or remote CD-writers.

Changes: The data structures were modified to allow for new features in
the future. The speed= option no longer defaults to speed 1, but rather to
a drive-specific value that is maximum speed for modern drives. A new test
that prevents writing to CD-RW media too slowly was included, the DVD
write speed is now displayed correctly, and preparation has been made for
allowing the -dao option to work when writing DVDs. A bug that caused it
to complain when trying to write to CD-RW media at 10x or faster was also
fixed.

System :: Archiving :: Backup

About: dobackup.pl is a flexible Perl script to handle unattended
incremental backups of multiple servers. It handles multiple media sets
with automatic media preparation and rotation, configurable
'what-to-backup', global per-host exclusion patterns, and user settable
'don't-back-this-up' metafiles. Its design goal is zero-maintenance,
nothing to do except change the media when told.

Changes: Fixed the options the were broken during the recent Getopt::Long
switchover, as well as base-2 numbers and SI (KiB, MiB, etc.) unit
reporting. Some previously unimplemented options have had code added, and
a usable man page has been included, along with revised documentation.

  by Gervase Markham (http://freshmeat.net/users/gerv/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 23:59

Database
Other/Nonlisted Topic
Text Processing :: Filters

About: DSML is the Directory Services Markup Language, an XML dialect for
working with directory information. The DSML Tools provide for the
querying of any LDAP directory (with search results output as DSML), the
importing of DSML data into any LDAP directory, the directory-context
validation of DSML (checking for illegal attributes in the entries, etc.),
and the calculation of the differences (for a directory) between two DSML
documents to provide an XML Diff algorithm for DSML data. This software
makes all LDAP-supporting directories DSML-enabled. It can also check the
integrity of DSML data, and show at a glance how two data sets,
represented as DSML, differ.

Changes: Xerces 2.0.2 is now used as the XML parser, as 1.3.0 is no longer
available or supported. Other tweaks include an "attributes only"
command-line option (-o), a few fixed NullPointerExceptions, and UTF8
output.

About: Dzt is a YATGT (Yet Another Tabbed GNOME Terminal). It was inspired
by PowerShell, which did not seem stable enough for daily use. The main
goal is to provide a multi-tabbed/paged terminal for GNOME which is
simple, configurable, and quick to use.

Changes: This release updates config help files, changes handling of tab
title padding, patches some memory leaks, removes dead code, and has other
behind the scenes changes. It also improves the look of tab/window title
padding.

Magellan unique functions, it is possible to include many elements in the
same page, while maintaining the same overall appearance.  

Changes: A relations class was added for compatibility with old modules
which rely on it. A lot of code was optimized by changing double quotes to
single quotes. Occurrences of "&" were changed to "&" in tag handlers in
order to validate the output code.

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 00:52

Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: MessageWall is an SMTP proxy. It sits between the outside world and
your mail server and keeps out viruses, spam, and mail relaying. It offers
filtering via header and body checks, DNS-based blacklists for IP
addresses (DNSBL) and domains (RHSBL), DNS-based distributed checksumming
(DNS DCC) similar to Vipul's Razor, and Open AntiVirus pattern scanning.
Unlike many existing ISP-level filtering solutions, it offers
customization of filtering features on a per-address basis. Unlike
SpamAssassin, it communicates via SMTP, so it works with any MTA. It also
supports scoring based on rules with a rejection threshold; this allows
hybrid warning/rejection configurations based on how many and which rules
a message matches.

Changes: Cleaned up the freeing of memory when clients are closed, and
fixed bugs in the parsing of invalid SMTP lines and SIGPIPE handling.

[046] - Netics 2.0
  by Marius Aamodt Eriksen (http://freshmeat.net/users/mae/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 12:44

About: Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the
network interface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it
strips off the appropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at
specified intervals, either in a "progress bar" mode or as raw statistics.
Currently, it supports 2 statistics, both involving entropy: LZW
compressability and Ueli Maurer's universal statistical test. Maurer's
test is a very good and comprehensive measure of entropy, but requires a
large amount of data. The LZW statistic requires much less data.

Changes: This release adds an Ueli Mauer scan, a progress bar, and a
generic interface.

  by Michael Chaney (http://freshmeat.net/users/mdchaney/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 23:58

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: PHP Auth is a very flexible framework for PHP applications that is
loosely based on phplib. It requires PHP4 session support. The main
difference between PHP Auth and phplib is the improved auth class.
Additionally, PHP Auth includes support for user registration and
user-level and admin-level account administration (change username,
password, etc.). It currently has support only for MySQL, however, the
database functionality is completely abstracted away from the rest of the
code, so changes for other database systems should be trivial.

Changes: This version contains a very minor bugfix in register.php, and a
new class to provide an easy interface to authorize.net's service. There
are also a couple of new functions to validate the checksum and expiration
date of a credit card number, and a few more samples in the template
directory to help you get started with using curl or credit card
processing.

  by Glenn Randers-Pehrson (http://freshmeat.net/users/glennrp/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 01:57

Multimedia :: Graphics :: Graphics Conversion
System :: Archiving :: Compression

About: pngcrush is an excellent batch-mode compression utility for PNG
images. Depending on the application that created the original PNGs, it
can improve the file size anywhere from a few percent to 40% or more
(completely losslessly). The utility also allows specified PNG chunks
(e.g. text comments) to be inserted or deleted, and it can fix incorrect
gamma info written by Photoshop 5.0 as well as the erroneous iCCP chunk
written by Photoshop 5.5.

Changes: This release has been built with libpng-1.2.4 and zlib-1.1.4, and
contains a work-around for the CPU timer wraparound feature.

information about public projects to clients, peers, and bosses. 

Changes: New features in this release include the ability to read a system
default header.html and footer.html, and fixes for a couple of bugs that
may have allowed a cracker to get a directory listing using a malformed
URL.

[058] - PTypes C++ Portable Types Library 1.4.0

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 10:38

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers
Software Development :: Libraries
Software Development :: Libraries :: Application Frameworks

About: The C++ Portable Types Library (PTypes) is a simple alternative to
the STL that includes multithreading and networking. It defines dynamic
strings, character sets, lists, and other basic data types along with
threads, synchronization, and IP sockets. It is portable across modern
Unix and Windows systems, and includes a sample HTTP daemon showing the
full power of the library.

Changes: A big sample program called wshare is now included in the
project. Wshare is a simple and fast HTTP/1.1 web server which
demonstrates the full power of PTypes. Wshare currently lacks server-side
scripting functionality, but it can be used to quickly share local files
over the Web. Waiting for data with timeout on a socket object is
implemented (ipsocket::waitfor()). SIGPIPE is now blocked on Unix when
using PTypes' sockets. A bugfix was made for autofree threads. Please note
that the semantics of thread::waitfor() have changed.

[062] - SAPRFC 1.1
  by Eduard Koucky (http://freshmeat.net/users/koucky/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 06:26

Internet :: WWW/HTTP

About: SAPRFC is the extension module for PHP4 that  allows call ABAP
functions in an SAP R/3 system  from PHP scripts. It is also possible to
write an RFC  server program in PHP, and call PHP functions from  ABAP.
Other features include using the RFC  (Remote Function Call) API to make a
call,  discovering the interface of a function module, and  mapping all
RFC types to PHP strings (delivered  with a test script that has a similar
function to  the "Single Test" option in the SE37 transaction). 

Changes: The offset position for structure fields in the internal buffer
is now determined from the OFFSET value returned by
RFC_GET_FUNCTION_INTERFACE_P. This resolves data corruption problems for
parameters or tables that have structures that include other structures,
such as the MARA table.

About: Simple Rescue CD is a small Linux rescue CD,  suitable for booting
systems that have become  unbootable due to filesystem corruption or 
other problems. It lies somewhere between  minimalist boot floppies and
large full-featured  rescue systems, and as such is suitable for  when
space is tight, such as on business card  CDs.

Changes: The kernel was upgraded to 2.4.18, and minor boot script changes
were made to cope better with multiple CDROMs.

[070] - ThumbNails 3.0.1
  by Al Evans (http://freshmeat.net/users/anejr/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 12:17

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: ThumbNails is an automated system for creating and maintaining web
sites containing large numbers of digital photographs or other images. It
will go through a group of directories filled with pictures, make
thumbnail images of each picture, make HTML pages for each directory
showing clickable thumbnails for each picture, and make an overall
index.html document for the HTML pages it creates. It can use a MySQL
database to hold picture titles, captions, and other information. The
database information can be edited over the web, and can be displayed
along with the pictures. It includes a daemon which periodically checks
the pictures directories and database (if used), updating the web site
automatically as needed.

Changes: This release improves site layout and user navigation. It can
create individual thumbnail HTML pages for one or all levels of picture
directories. It provides control for forward/reverse sorting the main
index, subdirectory image groups or links, and thumbnails on each HTML
page. Navigating the hierarchy of thumbnail pages is made explicit by
forward and backward links. Users can navigate through a group of images
via "previous" and "next" links. It is completely compatible with picture
directories and MySQL databases from previous versions.

bugfixes for InterBase. Issues were fixed where a specialized self
reference was converted to a 'not null' column, which should have been a
'null' column, and the output of "get some", which was wrong in certain
cases.

[088] - xrmap 2.22 (Stable)

Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: Xrmap is a program running under X that can interactively display
portions of the Earth, using the huge CIA world vector map. It is based on
an earlier console utility 'rmap'. It features political boundaries, major
and minor rivers, glaciers, lakes, canals, etc. The map remains accurate
under a very large zoom factor, which can possibly exceed 100. Spherical,
rectangular, Mercator and Miller projections are implemented, and all
features can be interactively set from the GUI. 

Changes: The new built-in map editor allows user-defined objects or
actions to be added to the map. These could include pixmaps, colored
regions, the execution of programs linked to geographical locations, and
more. The locations database has been extended, and now includes 8800
airports and 90 astronomical entries.
