Category: Communications :: Chat

About: ARSC Really Simple Chat is a Web chat system that uses PHP and
MySQL. It aims to work with every browser in existence, and it uses the

simple to install and use ARSC. It includes some important features, such
as operators, kick-ing, whispering, and more. Multiple rooms and different
languages are available. To run ARSC on your site, you need a Web server
that understands PHP, and can connect to a MySQL database.

Changes: A socket server was added (to allow better chat performance, and
less RAM and CPU usage) using the new pcntl feature of PHP4.0.7RC2, as well
as some chat commands. Many minor bugs were fixed, so compatibility with
every browser around has become a reality.

[025] - JSwat Java Debugger 1.4.2
  by Nathan Fiedler (http://freshmeat.net/users/nfiedler/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 00:35

Category: Software Development :: Debuggers

About: jswat is a graphical, stand-alone Java debugger, using the JPDA
library. It offers all of the basic features you would expect from a

Changes: Simple conditionals for breakpoints, where the condition is
satisfied when a variable equals a value, and dialogs for setting the
classpath and sourcepath have been added. The classpath no longer
automatically appears in the "Start VM" dialog, so the program can tell if
you entered it or not.

Categories: Software Development :: Libraries, System :: Filesystems

About: libferris is a virtual filesystem that exposes hierarchical data of
all kinds through a common C++ interface. Access to data is performed using
C++ IOStreams and Extended Attributes (EA) can be attached to each datum to
present metadata. Ferris uses a plugin API to read various data sources and
expose them as contexts and to generate interesting EA. Current
implementations include Native (kernel disk IO with event updates using
fam), xml (mount an xml file as a filesystem), edb (mount a berkeley
database), ffilter (mount an LDAP filter string) and mbox (mount your
mailbox). EA generators include image, audio, and animation decoders. 

Changes: Support was added for sorting by string, numeric sorting, and
reverse sorting. The ls client was extended to use the new sorting API.

About: Lilo is a Boot loader for Linux/x86 and other PC operating systems.
Lilo is responsible for loading your Linux kernel from either a floppy or a
hard drive and giving it control of the system. It can also be used to boot
many other operating sysetms, including the BSD variants, DOS, and OS/2.
The Lilo distribution includes full source, documentation and support
files, but no pre-compiled binaries. Lilo is capable of booting beyond
cylinder 1024 of a hard disk if the BIOS supports EDD packet call
extensions to the int 0x13 interface.

Changes: A graphical user interface using VGA 640x480x16 (mode 0x12) has
been added. Secure passwords have been implemented using four CRC-32
polynomials. RAID1 codes are completely re-written, and correctly implement
'lock', 'fallback', and 'lilo -R'. The new RAID1 implementation is not
compatible with version 21. Those using version 21 should read
'README.raid1' before installing these new codes. There is a compatibility
mode for existing RAID1 installations which are not going to be converted
to the new implementation.

BOOL, ARRAYS, BYTEA, etc. This module is written in Python, and works with
PostgreSQL 7.0 or later, and Python 2.0 or later. Use of Python 2.1 or
later, and PostgreSQL 7.1 or later is highly recommended. NB: pyPgSQL was
previously released under the name 'PgSQL'. 

Changes: pyPgSQL 1.6 adds support for PostgreSQL's BYTEA type. It also
corrects problems with escaping/quoting strings that use alternate
character encodings. Also, there have also been numerous bug fixes made in
little used methods in the libpq module.

[057] - SpamAssassin 1.2
  by Justin Mason (http://freshmeat.net/users/jmason/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 06:10

Category: Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: SpamAssassin is a mail filter that uses a wide range of heuristic
tests on mail headers and body text to identify spam.  Once identified, the
mail can then be optionally  tagged as spam for later filtering using the
user's  own mail user-agent application.   It provides a command line tool
to  perform filtering, along with Mail::SpamAssassin, a set of Perl modules
which implement a Mail::Audit  plugin, allowing SpamAssassin to be used in
a  Mail::Audit filter or in a spam-protection proxy POP/IMAP server.   

Changes: Some new tests were added, as well as MIME header decoding. Some
tests were rescored, based on statistical analysis of a large mail spool,
and several tests were fixed to provide better scoring. spamassassin -d now
only removes body lines inside the report, not in the mail in general.
Memory usage has been reduced on really big mails.

[059] - Spirit Parser library 1.2.0rc1
  by Dan Nuffer (http://freshmeat.net/users/nuffer/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 11:52

Categories: Software Development :: Code Generators, Software Development
:: Compilers, Software Development :: Interpreters, Software Development ::
Libraries

About: Spirit is an object-oriented, recursive descent parser generator
framework implemented using template meta-programming techniques.
Expression templates allow Spirit to approximate the syntax of Extended
Backus Normal Form (EBNF) completely in C++. The Spirit framework enables a
target grammar to be written exclusively in C++. EBNF grammar
specifications can mix freely with other C++ code and, thanks to the
generative power of C++ templates, are immediately executable.

Changes: New features include character sets, symbol tables, an STL-like
iterator interface, more examples, debugging output, numeric parsers, and
string parsers.

Category: Games/Entertainment

About: Star Voyager is a Frontier/Elite-style game in a more arcade-style
2D environment, themed to the Star Trek universe. It uses the SDL library
for  portability. 

Changes: This release has more combat-friendly viewing, damage 'juddering',
much improved speed on loading savegames, a sound toggle, and more sounds
effects. The graphics routines are greatly sped up for non-8-bit displays.
A possible startup deadlock has been fixed. The combat AI has been
redesigned. There is a new targeting option. 'make install' is supported.

Category: Internet :: WWW/HTTP

About: SwiftSurf is an HTTP proxy that lets you do a lot of things. You can
spy, filter, and modify the HTTP requests that your browser sends, as well
as the answers it receives. Some of its possible uses include filtering
ads, limiting access to a specific domain, or suppressing cookies.

Changes: This release includes HTTP/1.1 compliance (though not in the most
efficient way). This enables the use of Mozilla without special
configuration.

[063] - Text::EtText 2.2

  Monday, October 1st 2001 06:11

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries,
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: EtText is a simple plain-text format which allows conversion to and
from HTML. It provides an easy-to-edit, easy-to-read and intuitive way to
write HTML, based on plain-text markup conventions.  Like most simple text
markup formats (POD, setext, etc.), EtText markup handles the usual things:
insertion of paragraph tags, header recognition, and markup. However it
also adds a powerful link markup system, and tries to generate code which
conforms to XHTML. 

Changes: Hn headers now have autogenerated id attributes, as well as name
attributes for XHTML conformance. The list handling code was rewritten from
scratch to match txt2html's capabilities. An optional new link format was
added, using double-square-brackets, to reduce mangling of third-party text
that contains quotes, or square brackets.

[065] - Tiny SRP 0.7.5
  by Dr. Tom (http://freshmeat.net/users/professortom/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 11:18

Categories: Communications, Internet, Security, Software Development ::
Libraries

About: The Tiny SRP library is a stripped-down version of srp-1.7.1 and
openssl-0.9.6 that contains only what is necessary for secure remote
passphrase authentication. No other libraries are required. If you already
have libsrp installed on both server and client then you don't need this.
Tiny SRP is designed for embedded or mini distributions, and is also a
quick and easy way to add secure authentication to small client/server
projects. Also included is the TSRP protocol, which reduces socket
authentication to one function call on each of the client and server.

Changes: A missing initialization in tconf was fixed.

[066] - Turbo Vision 1.1.2 (Beta)
  by Salvador Eduardo Tropea (SET) (http://freshmeat.net/users/setsoft/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 13:20

Category: Software Development :: Libraries :: Application Frameworks

About: Turbo Vision is a C++ library that provides a very nice user
interface for console applications. This UNIX port is based on Borland's
version 2.0 with fixes. It was made to create RHIDE, a nice IDE for gcc and
other GNU compilers. The library supports /dev/vcsa devices for fast access
to local consoles, and it uses ncurses to run from telnet and xterm. This
port, in contrast to the Sigala's port, doesn't have "100% compatibility
with the original library" as goal. Instead, many modifications were made
for the sake of security (especially buffer overflows). This port is also
available for the original platform (DOS). 

Changes: Fixes for endianness problems (mouse, shadows, and keyboard),
testing with Linux/PPC and Linux/SPARC, and new support for CygWin (Win32)
and gcc 3.x (the demo and tutorial hit a bug in libstdc++ v3).

  by aurlio marinho jargas (http://freshmeat.net/users/verde666/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 20:17

Category: Other/Nonlisted Topic

About: txt2tags is a generic text converter that generates  HTML, sgml,
Magic Point (mgp), MoinMoin, and  Adobe PageMaker documents from simple
text files.  Any other marked up language can be added. It is  in Python,
so no external commands or libraries are  needed.

Changes: A new 'man' target document, and a nice shell wrapper to deal with
files/directories/options (in fact, the Python code is now "embedded" in
the shell script).

[068] - uDHCP Server/Client 0.9.6
  by Russ Dill (http://freshmeat.net/users/r2600/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 15:50

Category: System :: Networking

About: uDHCP Server/Client is an embedded DHCP client  and server that can
be compiled seperately (17k  each), or as one combined binary (25k). The
server  stores its lease file periodically, or by a signal (for  systems
with flash memory) in terms of absolute  time of lease expiration, or time
remaining in a lease  (for systems with no clocks). The client calls helper
 scripts to do the work of configuring the interfaces  for more
flexibility.

Changes: bootp paramater support was added to both the server and the
client. The client now adds a vendor id to each request. Pidfile handling
is improved and standardized across the client and server. Man pages were
added to the client and server.

[070] - vmail-sql 0.5
  by Chris Lightfoot (http://freshmeat.net/users/chrisexparrotcom/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 20:13

Categories: Communications :: Email, Communications :: Email :: Post-Office
:: POP3

About: vmail-sql is a complete virtual domains email setup, including
sample Exim configuration sections, reference to tpop3d which will
authenticate access to mailspools against the virtual user database, a set
of admin-level scripts for administrating domains, and a Web-based control
panel. Rather than storing the virtual domains setup in flat text files, it
uses a MySQL database, allowing flexible administration strategies without
concurrency hassles. It is designed for use in environments where several
virtual domains are operated from a single machine/IP address.

Changes: Widened primary keys in the database, fixes for various uniqueness
problems, support for domain aliasing, and a fix for an unfortunate
security blunder in the passwd_popbox script.

About: Walk500 is a Rio500 management tool for the Gnome desktop. It is a
replacement tool for all the rio500-related command-line utilities.

Changes: A lot of bugs have been fixed (including the "adding song"
segfault), memory leaks have been shut, and UI enhancements have been made.
libglade is now required. Upgrading is strongly recommended.

[072] - WebMake 2.2
  by Justin Mason (http://freshmeat.net/users/jmason/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 06:14

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP, Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management,
Text Processing :: Markup

About: WebMake is a simple Web site management system, allowing an entire
site to be created from an optional set of text and markup files and one
WebMake file. It requires no dynamic scripting capabilities on the server,
and can be run entirely offline. It allows the separation of
responsibilities between content editors, page designers, and the site
architect. Only the site architect needs to edit the WebMake file itself,
or know Perl or WebMake code. Perl scripts can be embedded and executed to
build pages. Automatic dependency tracking means that pages will not be
rebuilt unless necessary. Metadata support means that indexes etc. can be
built automatically.

Changes: 'Concepts' documentation has been added, along with a wmview.cgi
(a single-page-viewer CGI script to allow viewing WebMake output without
having to pregenerate it), parameterised references (e.g. ${template:
body=foo}), a thumbnail tag to support image galleries, and a 'skip'
attribute for data sources. Media files now pick up implicit titles from
their filenames, and data sources can now pick up metadata from metatable
files within the directory tree. Some bugs have been fixed.

  by cliff (http://freshmeat.net/users/iamcliff/)
  Monday, October 1st 2001 00:04

Category: Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Capture/Recording

About: xmcd2make is a set of Perl scripts which support users of the
gramofile recording, track splitting, and signal processing package.   It
consists of 3 userland tools: findtracks.pl (a command line interface to
gramofile track detection), signalproc.pl (a command line interface to
gramofile track splitting and signal processing), and xmcd2make.pl (a
script that takes an xmcd file of song names and track timing files and
creates a makefile).  When the makefile is run, it splits the tracks,
performs gramofile signal processing, and encodes the resulting tracks to
Ogg Vorbis format with the correct song names and good tags.      

Changes: Support has been added for ripping CDs using cdparanoia.

About: Bitmovers Maui is a Java-based technology for developing user
interfaces for server-side applications that deploy dynamically to a
variety of network-enabled platforms. Maui's intuitive API makes building
interfaces simple -- no need for templates, and no need to know the many
nuances of each markup language. It has a fully  object-oriented and
event-based environment, automatic image generation, and a rich set of
components. The Maui server is 100% Java. It handles the client- specific
output for you, currently supporting Web, WAP, and Wireless Palm devices.
Secure Sockets over HTTP are supported, and it has a need-based caching
system. 

Changes: Some fixes to the WAP side of Maui for some ClassCastExceptions
which were occuring when accessing Maui through a WAP browser, and
optimized rendering of MRadioButtons on Palm/WCA devices.

huge amount of runtime overhead to support, and hence can make C++ and
threads suitable even for the development of trivial servers and
applications.

Changes: A new std::exception-based exception handling model and namespace
support, use of a single unified source tree for Win32/POSIX development,
and addition of a Common C++ Template library.

  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 13:07

Scientific/Engineering

About: EvoChess is a scientific experiment that uses  Internet-connected
computers in the evolution of  chess playing programs. You can participate
by  running qoopy, an environment for distributed  computing as done by
EvoChess. The users can  start their own evolution to develop a variety of 
chess programs. The better ones will survive and  produce offspring, who
inherit their successful  behavior encoded in their genotype. To run it,
Java 1.3 must be installed. 

Changes: The evolution has been partly restarted with new but compatible
chess-playing individuals, characterized by a more sophisticated and
experimental behavior in search. It is possible to replace, initialize,
mutate, and recombine individuals manually. Individuals can also be loaded
from a file into the population, weak playing individuals will be
identified and replaced quickly, and good ones will skip the first games.

set of machine's configurations in one session.

Changes: This release adds the ability to run OS commands as an alternate
user.  It adds $USER, $HOSTNAME, $HOME, $PWD environment variables to the
Run OS command environment, the ability to send OS command output to a
command output window instead of redirect to a file, the ability to upgrade
all hosts in the cluster just by doing Select-All and Upgrade, and the
ability to save the environment for OS commands. The install script now has
a no questions install. The command relay has been changed so that it will
send the commands to up to 40 hosts at a time.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site
Management

About: MML is an HTML templating preprocessor. Many sites these days adopt
a 'template'-based approach, with a constant set of navigation links, a
logo and a heading etc. MML aims to make this process more efficient by
separating the content from the template and abstracting the template in
various ways for increased flexibility. 

Changes: Support for initscripts tied to styles, and a minor speed
enhancement to the HTML processor with the XML empty element hack.

[034] - OpenDRDA prealpha2
  by Brian Bruns (http://freshmeat.net/users/camber/)
  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 12:51

Database

About: OpenDRDA is an open source implementation of the DRDA (Distributed
Relational Database Architecture) protocol developed by IBM and endorsed as
an OpenGroup standard for client to database server communication. The
OpenDRDA project's goal is to create an open implementation of the
standard, initially as an ODBC client driver, and eventually to bring DRDA
server-side support to all major open source databases.  

Changes: OpenDRDA is now capable of querying a DB2 (or other DRDA) data
source and returning results. The authors still need developers, especially
those with access to test against DB2 on OS/400 and MVS platforms.
Interested developers without access to a DRDA server can contact the list.

[035] - Openwall Linux kernel patch 2.2.20-ow1
  by Solar Designer (http://freshmeat.net/users/solardiz/)
  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 03:01

Security System :: Operating System Kernels :: Linux System :: Systems
Administration

About: The Openwall Linux kernel patch is a collection of security
"hardening" features for the Linux kernel. In addition to the new features,
some versions of the patch contain various security fixes. The "hardening"
features of the patch, while not a complete method of protection, provide
an extra layer of security against the easier ways to exploit certain
classes of vulnerabilities and/or reduce the impact of those
vulnerabilities. The patch can also add a little bit more privacy to the
system by restricting access to parts of /proc so that users may not see
what others are doing.

Changes: We have updated to Linux 2.2.20, which adds a workaround for a
vulnerability with certain packet filter setups, and SYN cookies where the
packet filter rules could be bypassed. Additionally, even more of the
support for combined ELF/a.out setups has been moved under a separate
configuration option.

About: SUBMIT is a Web-based system for university computer science
departments which allows the submission and assessment of students'
programming assignments. Programs are validated, compiled, and executed on

markers. Markers can write comments which are available to the students.
Detailed statistics of each project are available to the lecturer. Students
can submit as individuals or as a group. C, C++, Python, and Java are
supported.  . There is a tight security model for Java: the security
features of the language prevent student assignments from using the
filesystem or network while running on the server. The server cannot be
(easily) crashed by the student programs. 

Changes: Support for languages other than Java has been added (but not
fully tested).

  by Bruce Guenter (http://freshmeat.net/users/bruceguenter/)
  Saturday, November 3rd 2001 17:20

Internet :: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)

About: Twoftpd is an FTP server that strives to be secure, simple, and
efficient. None of the commands can cause execution of other programs, and
the normal model of execution does a chroot to the logged in user's
directory immediately after authentication. The name "twoftpd" comes from
the fact that there are two parts to the server: an authenticating front
end, which contains no file or data transfer code, and one of two back
ends, which contain all the data transfer code. 

Changes: A fix for a bug in the string sort implementation that caused
listings to leak memory, a fix for PASV connection mode to only show the
150 response if the connection does not fail, a workaround for broken
firewalls that rewrite certain commands (specifically PORT) with two CR
characters before the final LF, strip trailing slashes from the home path,
use of corked (Linux) or no-push (BSD) socket mode to improve transfer
efficiency, and some other minor fixes to socket handling and response
messages.

[001] - abcde 2.0.2 (Stable)
  by Robert Woodcock (http://freshmeat.net/users/rcw/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 16:34

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: CD Audio :: CD Ripping

About: abcde is a frontend to cdparanoia, wget, cd-discid, id3, and your
favorite Ogg/MP3 encoder (Oggenc is the default). It grabs an entire CD and
converts each track to Ogg/MP3, then comments or ID3-tags each file, all
with one command. It supports parallelization, SMP, HTTP proxies,
customizable filename organization and munging, playlist generation, and
remote distributed encoding via distmp3.

Changes: Bladeenc support is actually fixed this time. Honest.

[002] - aiSee Graph Visualization Software 2.1.35 (Stable)
  by Schwalex (http://freshmeat.net/users/Schwalex/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 12:20

Education Multimedia :: Graphics Multimedia :: Graphics :: Presentation

About: aiSee reads a textual, easy-to-read and easy-to-learn graph
specification and automatically calculates a customizable graph layout.
This layout is then displayed, and can be printed or interactively
explored. aiSee features 15 basic graph layout algorithms (including
force-directed layout), recursive subgraph nesting, fish-eye views, and an
animation interface. It has been optimized to handle huge graphs
automatically generated by applications (e.g. compilers). It is available
for Linux, Solaris, NetBSD, SunOS, and Windows.

Changes: This release includes file operation enhancements; for instance,
File->Save now supports saving subgraph coordinates. The exporting of
graphs to (encapsulated) PostScript was enhanced. Furthermore, a filter
function has been implemented in node the title dialog boxp, and a better
algorithm for double-focus fish-eye views has been implemented. The latter
is an experimental feature. Some minor bugs have been remedied.

About: Axel tries to accelerate downloads by using multiple connections
(possibly to multiple servers) for one download. Because of its size, it
might be very useful on bootdisks or other small systems as a wget
replacement.

Changes: Ports to a lot of Unixes and Win32, a new build system, and one
little bugfix.

[008] - CdBase perl/Tk 0.2.6 (stable)
  by Dany Vanderroost (http://freshmeat.net/users/danyv/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 16:33

Database :: Front-Ends

About: CdBase greps the cdlabel and contents of a CD and places them in a
PgSQL database. The database has one generic table (cdlabel, file) and one
table per CD (path, file, readme, install). English is the default
language, but other languages are supported (de, es, fr, it & nl). The
search function takes its result from the generic table and opens a new
window to show the appropriate file(s) from each CD table. CdBase is
written in Perl/Tk and works fine on a P100.

Changes: This release adds German and Dutch translations. A bug where the
count procedure didn't refresh has been fixed, and a Spanish translation is
in progress.

Communications :: File Sharing System :: Archiving

About: cfv is a utility to both test and create .sfv (Simple File Verify),
.csv, md5sum, and bsd md5 files. These files are commonly used to ensure
the correct retrieval or storage of data.

Changes: A fix for a file.close() exception on -C in empty dir, mmap
support for faster checksumming when not using fchksum module, handling
files made by programs that add quotes to filenames, print stats about
number of case differences and quoted filenames, display seperate stats per
checksum file, a fix for excessive memory usage on deep recursive create
mode in tree with lots of files, throwing an exception for an unaccessible
dir in recursive mode, and an already existing checksum file causes a
cferror rather than an immediate exit in create mode.

  Thursday, December 6th 2001 17:40

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries Software
Development Software Development :: Quality Assurance

About: Codestriker is a Perl CGI script that is used for performing code
reviews in a collaborative fashion, as opposed to using unstructured
emails. Authors create code review topics, the nominated reviewers being
automatically notified by email. Reviewers then submit comments against the
code on a per-line basis, and can view comments submitted by the other
reviewers as they are created. Emails are sent to the appropriate parties,
as an alert mechanism, when comments are created. The author is free to
submit comments against the review comments. Once all reviewers have
finished the author has all review comments available in a structured
fashion, instead of a pile of unstructured emails.  

Changes: Code review comments for specific line numbers can be seen on the
main view page by moving your mouse over the line number. If Microsoft IE
is used, a tooltip will appear with the comments. The status line is also
used for this purpose, to avoid the necessity of going to the edit page to
view the comments that have already been made.

[011] - Cyrus IMAP server 2.1.0
  by Larry Greenfield (http://freshmeat.net/users/larrygreenfield/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 14:12

Communications :: Email :: Post-Office :: IMAP Internet

About: The Cyrus IMAP is generally intended to be run on sealed servers,
where normal users are not permitted to log in. The mailbox database is
stored in parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP
system. All user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP
protocols. The private mailbox database design gives the server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The
server supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on
mailbox hierarchies, multiple SASL mechanisms, and the Sieve mail filtering
language.

Changes: This release uses the Cyrus SASL 2.0 library, allows for an
alternative namespace and hierarchy separator that may work better with
some clients, and can support full-text mailbox indexing. There are many
other minor changes.

have been fixed: The background of an empty cell now appears even with
Netscape, and the select input field now appears correctly (even with
Netscape).

Communications Internet Software Development :: Libraries

About: FNR or "Free Network Registrar" is based on an idea implemented on
CAR (Cisco Access Registrar) by Cisco Systems, which lets you run your own
DHCP/BOOTP/DNS server.  The interesting aspect of it is its modules
support, based on shared libraries (c code) or scripts (tcl/tk).  FNR is
basically a generic server; you can run whatever you want to.  You can code
a mini-dhcp or mini-telnet or mini-whatever server.  Each extension can
access two different environments, both handled and loaded at startup time
(like daemontools) with "envdir".  This environment lets you read/write
variables and log to files.

cross-debuggers (VxWorks, Lynx, etc.). For instance, you can use Linux or
Windows to debug an application running on a Power PC board with a debugger
running on a Sun workstation.

Changes: This release features general stabilization and improvements in
error/warning messages, better handling of VxWorks targets, and friendler
handling of Yes/No type of dialogs. The main source file is now shown in
the explorer when it opens. The fields in the "New Debugger" dialog are now
filled with parameters from the command line. A message dialog now pops up
when trying to detach a process while the underlying debugger is busy. The
column sizes and visibility for the stack window are now remembered from
one session to another. The explorer now displays the return type for
functions. Several bugfixes were made.

[028] - International Components for Unicode (C/C++) 2.0
  by steven r loomis (http://freshmeat.net/users/strcpy/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 13:59

Other/Nonlisted Topic Software Development :: Libraries

About: ICU provides a Unicode implementation, with functions for formatting
numbers, dates, times, and currencies (according to locale conventions,
transliteration, and parsing text in those formats). It provides flexible
patterns for formatting messages, where the pattern determines the order of
the variable parts of the messages, and the format for each of those
variables. These patterns can be stored in resource files for translation
to different languages. Included are more than 100 codepage converters for
interaction with non-unicode systems.

Changes: All of ICU supports the full Unicode 3.1.1 range, which includes
supplementary characters. It's easier to use more than one version of ICU
at the same time. Transliteration has many more features. The Unicode
normalization algorithm has been sped up. A new string search API has been
added. Various collation improvements have been added.

graphical interface to configure alarms, you can use the command line, and
there is a DCOP interface for other applications. KAlarm will only run on
the KDE2 desktop. Note that this application is unrelated to KAlarm for
KDE1. 

Changes: An option to repeat alarms at login, and context help buttons were
added. Some bugfixes were made, and documentation installation was
improved.

[033] - Libtre regexp matching library 0.1.0
  by Ville Laurikari (http://freshmeat.net/users/vlaurika/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 17:21

Software Development :: Compilers Software Development :: Libraries Text
Processing :: Filters

About: Libtre is an attempt to create a lightweight, robust, and efficient
POSIX compliant regexp matching library. There is still some work left, 
but the results so far are promising.  At its core is a new algorithm for
regular expression matching with submatch addressing. The algorithm uses
linear worst-case time in the length of the text being searched, and
quadratic worst-case time in the length of the used regular expression. In
other words, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(MN), where M is the
length of the regular expression and N is the length of the text. The used
space is also quadratic on the length of the regex, but does not depend on
the searched string.

[055] - Smarty PHP template engine 1.5.0
  by Monte Ohrt (http://freshmeat.net/users/mohrt/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 18:01

Software Development

About: Smarty is a template engine for PHP. Many other template engines for
PHP provide basic variable substitution and dynamic block functionality.
Smarty takes a step further to be a "smart" template engine, adding
features such as configuration files, template functions, and variable
modifiers, and making all of this functionality as easy as possible to use
for both programmers and template designers. Smarty also converts the
templates into PHP scripts, eliminating the need to parse the templates on
every invocation. This makes Smarty extremely scalable and managable for
large application needs.

Changes: Several feature enhancements were made to this version, most
notably the {foreach ...} command, which is an alternative to {section ...}
with an easier syntax for looping through a single array of values. Several
functions were enhanced so that the output can be automatically assigned to
a template variable instead of displayed (assign attribute). Cache files
can now be controlled with a custom function as an alternative to the
built-in file based method. Many code cleanups and bugfixes went into this
release as well.

About: StarPlot is a GTK-based program, written in C++, which can be used
interactively to view three-dimensional perspective charts of stars. Charts
can be recentered, rotated, or zoomed in or out with a mouse click (this
can also, of course, be done via dialog boxes for more precision). Stars
may be viewed (or ignored) by spectral class and absolute magnitude. Other
features include support for both celestial and galactic coordinate
systems, the ability to display extended non-stellar objects, and a pop-up
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.  StarPlot is also packaged with starconvert, a
utility which converts line-oriented stellar data records to StarPlot
format. Most star data files available on the Internet can be converted
this way if a short file describing the original file format is provided to
starconvert. 

Changes: The program legend is now clickable, providing a shortcut to the
spectral class part of the Chart->Star Filter dialog box. Full
constellation names are now displayed and can be searched on.

[061] - Visual Molecular Dynamics 1.7.1b1
  by VMD (http://freshmeat.net/users/vmd/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 01:43

Multimedia :: Graphics :: 3D Rendering Multimedia :: Graphics :: Viewers
Scientific/Engineering :: Bio-Informatics

About: VMD (Visual Molecular Dynamics) is designed for the visualization
and analysis of biological systems such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipid
bilayer assemblies, etc. It may be used to view more general molecules, as
VMD can read standard Protein Data Bank (PDB) files and display the
contained structure. VMD provides a wide variety of methods for rendering
and coloring a molecule: simple points and lines, CPK spheres and
cylinders, licorice bonds, backbone tubes and ribbons, cartoon drawings,
and others. VMD can be used to animate and analyze the trajectory of a
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In particular, VMD can act as a
graphical front end for an external MD program by displaying and animating
a molecule undergoing simulation on a remote computer.

Changes: This is a pre-release version. It features a new volume rendering
code, 3-D texturing, support for scanline-interleaved stereoscopic
rendering for Eye3D stereo glasses, multiple levels of transparency using
screen-door polygon stippling, and significant improvements to Tachyon, and
POV-Ray ray traced scene export features.

[062] - Vstr string library 0.5.3
  by Nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 01:58

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. It works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la "C strings". It can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

Changes: Some major bugfixes have been made, and a slight API change has
been made from 0.5.1.

[064] - WeSQL 0.50
  by Ward Vandewege (http://freshmeat.net/users/wardv/)
  Thursday, December 6th 2001 12:08

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: The Web-enabled SQL (WeSQL) library is an extension to HTML, acting
as a glue between HTML and SQL. It allows the use of pure SQL queries
directly in HTML files, embedded in a special tag, among many other
features. It translates the special tags into pure HTML, so using it is
transparent for the browser. It is aimed at rapid web-database integration,
and written in Perl. Because it runs under mod_perl, it is fast. It
currently supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL as backend SQL databases. 

Changes: This version is a complete rewrite, with many enhancements. In
particular, the code is now a standard Perl module (installable with the
usual 'perl Makefile.PL && make && make test && su && make install'), and
there is an RPM for Redhat users. Many internal improvements were also
made.

  Thursday, December 6th 2001 05:31

Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: Xrmap is a program running under X that can interactively display
portions of the Earth, using the huge CIA world vector map. It is based on
an earlier console utility 'rmap'. It features political boundaries, major
and minor rivers, glaciers, lakes, canals, etc. The map remains accurate
under a very large zoom factor, which can possibly exceed 100. Spherical,
rectangular, Mercator and Miller projections are implemented, and all
features can be interactively set from the GUI. 

Changes: Some minor bugfixes have been made, e.g. for the use of wild cards
in the search routine. The default color scheme has been improved, and
there is a new option controlling the order in which features are drawn
(and may overlap).

Old Appindex categories eliminated
by Patrick Lenz (http://freshmeat.net/users/scoop/)
Section: freshmeat
Friday, January 11th 2002 11:07

We've been carrying our old 2-level categorization scheme with us since the
date we switched to the freshmeat II codebase on Jan 30th 2001. Over the
course of the past year, people have been able to move their projects from
the old category scheme to the new scheme. We have also repeatedly
contacted developers, encouraging them to update their project's
categorization. Effective today, all categories left over from freshmeat I
have been eliminated.

[014] - EchoWall Firewall 1.40
  by sbest (http://freshmeat.net/users/sbest/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 05:10

Security System :: Networking System :: Networking :: Firewalls

About: EchoWall is a package for creating an ipchains-based Linux firewall.
It is optimized for the LEAF/LRP distro, but was originally created for
Debian platforms. Its aim is simplicity for entry-level users. It presumes
the user is using a Linux box as a masquerading firewall/router for a
single Class-C address range. It manages services in an interesting way:
Instead of indicating the IP addresses of machines you want to act as
servers, you instead specify them by their MAC address. When run, the
echowall script automatically detects the current IP address associated
with this MAC address. This allows you to connect a service to a machine
whose IP address is dynamically assigned. EchoWall is pre-configured with
extentions that handle the firewalling and port-forwarding needs of over 30
services (eg., NetMeeting, Quake, Direct-X, etc.). VPN passthru and limited
DMZ support are also available. 

Changes: This release adds some fixes to support the 1.x release of
Dachstein which sports a repaired "cut" utility. It also includes version
0.3f of the gatping network scanner for both glibc 2.0.* and 2.1.* systems,
and adds support for the XBox Gateway.

[015] - Email address validation component 2002.01.12
  by Manuel Lemos (http://freshmeat.net/users/mlemos/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 22:55

Internet

About: This is a PHP class that attempts to validate a given e-mail address
at three levels: matching the address against a RFC compliant regular
expression, verifing the existence of the destination SMTP server by
verifying the respective DNS MX record, and connecting to that server to
see if the given address is accepted as a valid recipient. The class also
features a debugging output option that lets you see the remote SMTP server
connection and data exchange dialog to see the real cause why an apparently
valid address may not be accepting messages.

Changes: Replacing all strtok calls by an emulation class function named
Tokenize to avoid the problem of the behaviour that was broken by PHP
developers after version 4.0.6.

convert it to PNG. GLiv is very fast and smooth at rotating, zooming, and
panning if you have an OpenGL accelerated board.  

Changes: In this release, a dithering bug that caused crashes has been
fixed. The history support has been improved, and there is a new option in
the open dialog to load all files in the directory.

About: LANdialler allows any computer (Windows, Linux, etc.) on a small LAN
to control and share a modem attached to a *nix server. It is typically
used with IP masquerading or NAT on a Linux router to provide a house or
small office with shared, on-demand, Internet access. 

Changes: This is primarily a bugfix release. Upgrading is recommended. If
the external connection script/command fails to bring up the connection
(e.g. your modem isn't plugged into the phone line), version 0.2 would wait
for the connection to come up before allowing an attempt to reconnect. This
version fixes that bug so that when the client's Cancel button is clicked
under these circumstances, the connection attempt is canceled by the
server. The code is also much cleaner.

architecture, it assists in administration of large networks previously
complicated by nonconformant systems. It uses RPM to provide an additional
system layer on top of the operating system. It is fully self-contained (no
RPM pre-installation is required), installs itself by means of a tricky
bootstrapping procedure with minimal operating system intrusion, and
supports multiple installation instances.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site
Management Software Development :: Libraries :: Application Frameworks

About: SiteMesh was built upon the Java Servlet 2.3 API. It is a  web-page
layout system and web-application  integration system to aid in creating
large sites  consisting of many pages for which a consistent  look/feel,
navigation, and layout scheme is  required. It intercepts requests to any
static or  dynamically generated HTML page requested  through the
web-server, parses the page, obtains  properties, and data from the
content, and  generates an appropriate final page with  modifications to
the original. It is ideally suited for Java based sites (particularly JSP)
but can be dropped into any existing site that uses a Servlet engine
including static, CGI, PHP, and ColdFusion generated pages. 

Changes: The package structure has changed from com.sitemesh to
com.opensymphony.module.sitemesh.  A fix has been made for an atrocious
memory leak in PageFilter.  meta http-equiv tags are now added as
properties with the prefix meta.http-equiv.x, where x is the value of the
http-equiv attribute (eg., refresh).  The configuration files are not
case-sensitive anymore.  Many performance optimizations have been made in
FastPageParser.  Various bugfixes and small performance improvements have
been made.

[056] - QtUnit 0.9.2
  by Geert Bevin (http://freshmeat.net/users/gbevin/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 14:11

Software Development :: Quality Assurance Software Development :: Testing

About: QtUnit is a unit testing framework for C++ which compiles into a
shared library. It uses the Qt library for platform independence. Tests can
be compiled into modules which are automatically reloaded after
modification. The text and graphical testrunners are fully localized and
integrate perfectly into IDEs for the display of the exact source location
where failures occurred.

Changes: This release has a more relevant example testcase, better
reporting in case of system exceptions, and better support for detection of
the filename of test cases. A new view of registered tests has been
implemented; the classname is now shown as a seperate list item, and the
tests themselves only display the test method name. Test class listitems
are collapsible to make it easier to work with a lot of test cases.
TestUnit from QObject has been integrated to make it possible to use
signals and slots in testcases and testsuites. NULL has been replaced with
0. A French translation has been added.

[057] - Remote Access Session 0.6
  by Angel Ramos (http://freshmeat.net/users/seamus/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 12:13

Security

About: Remote Access Session is a security tool to analyze the integrity of
systems. The program tries to gain access to a system using the most
advanced techniques of remote intrusion. It can either work in normal mode
(which is fast) or hard mode (which is more intensive). There is a big
difference between Remote Access Session and other remote security audit
tools. If Remote Access Session finds a remote vulnerability that gives
user account or root, it will try to exploit it and it will return a shell.
This allows a network administrator to discard false positives regarding
remote vulnerabilities. It also includes all of the information from
service banners in its output. It performs vendor and version detection on
Web servers and other common servers, and also attempts remote OS
identification.  

Changes: The verify_software function has been rewritten for better
perfomance. 17 new remote exploits for different services have been added.

for files in an outgoing spool directory and sends them. It puts all
received SMS in an incoming spool directory, and can call any external
program for incoming or outgoing notification.

Changes: The program does not crash anymore when you use the loglevel
option and start it with "smsd -d".

  by nikhilwiz (http://freshmeat.net/users/nikhilwiz/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 12:10

Communications Communications :: Chat :: ICQ Internet

About: SMSTerm is a Perl script that uses the ICQ2000 protocol to send SMSs
to/from your mobile/computer. It runs a shell on a pty, and allows you to
directly send commands to the shell through SMS. Minimal authentication is
done over SMS before spawning a shell and offering it to the user on the
mobile phone. It is very useful for remote administration tasks, or
checking out the status of the network, or just to run some small chores on
your system while you are away. It uses the Expect.pm module to do its
chores. SMSTerm also includes a script to send SMS through the ICQ network
from the commandline to any GSM mobile.

Changes: Some minor fixes relating to the errors made by ICQ while sending
the SMS receipt have been handled. The Message-ID field in the SMS receipt
has been found to be munged by ICQ. This version fixes this in the main
smsterm.pl script as well as the icqsms-send.pl script.

has unique features such as selective non-indexing, on-the-fly filters,
user-selectable stemming, and more.

Changes: SWISH++ can now index stand-alone RTF files. The thread-pooling
code is now more robust, and better handling of TIME-WAIT state for daemon
connections was added.

About: The poldek is an RPM package management tool which allows you to
easily perform package verification, installation (including system
installation from scratch), upgrading, and removal. Package dependencies
are automatically handled, so if you try to install a package that needs
others to be installed, it will download all needed packages and install
them. It can divide a huge package set into fixed size chunks for the
purpose of placing packages on removable media like CDROM or ZIP. It can be
used in batch (like apt_get from Debian's APT) or interactive mode. The
interactive mode puts you into a readline interface with command line
autocompletion and history, similar to the shell mode of Perl's CPAN.

[074] - WebPerformance Trainer 2.3 Final
  by Michael S Czeiszperger (http://freshmeat.net/users/czei/)
  Friday, January 11th 2002 14:06

Internet :: WWW/HTTP Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management Software
Development :: Testing

About: WebPerformance Trainer is a load, stress, and performance testing
tool for Web servers. It simulates thousands of individual users hitting a
server at connection speeds between 14.4Kb/s and 100Mb/s. It supports URL
rewriting, dynamic form data, multiple servers, and unusual port numbers.
Statistics are collected at multiple levels, from the transaction down to
the individual HTTP request. Users can view, edit, or dynamically replace
hidden data such as the HTTP request and reply headers. It runs on Linux,
Solaris, Windows NT, and Windows 2000. 

Changes: This release fixes an SSL timeout bug, a bug where the user
couldn't edit commands that contain a valueless parameter, a bug where the
user can not load new data set into an existing dataset name, a bug where
UnknownHost errors are not logged, and a bug where changing the value of
one URL parameter and setting a filter (data replacement) for another on
the same URL caused the first parameter to retain it's original value
during test playback. The 'Recent Files' list has been changed so that
items move back to the top of the list when they are used.

[001] - arch 1.0pre3 (Release)
  by T Lord (http://freshmeat.net/users/tlord/)
  Friday, February 1st 2002 02:00

amounts of development on branches. It is intended to replace CVS and
corrects many mis-features of that system.  

Changes: In this release, past revisions can now be made available in a
(space efficient) forest of (ordinary) file system trees. There is a new
web browser for exploring the repositories.  A number of portability
glitches and minor bugs have been fixed, including a serious security bug
in with-ftp.

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries Software
Development :: Libraries

About: The HTML::Template module attempts to make using HTML templates
simple and natural. It extends standard HTML with a few new tags for
variables, loops, if/else blocks and includes. A file written with HTML and
these new tags is called a template. Using this module you fill in the
values for the variables and loops declared in the template. This allows
you to seperate design (the HTML) from the data, which you generate in the
Perl script. While there are many other HTML template systems available,
this module is simple and fast. It doesn't try to reinvent Perl CGI, it
just augments HTML with a few new and very useful abilities.

Changes: Bugfixes, documentation cleanups, and a new project Web site.

About: mod_ssl provides provides strong cryptography for the Apache 1.3
webserver via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer
Security (TLS v1). It is based on the SSL/TLS toolkit OpenSSL and supports
all SSL/TLS related functionality, including RSA and DSA/DH cipher support,
X.509 CRL checking, etc. Additionally it provides special Apache related
facilities like DBM and shared memory based inter-process SSL session
caching. per-URL SSL session renegotiations, DSO support, etc.

Changes: Apache has been updated to 1.3.23. A subtle indexing bug in SHMCB
has been fixed. The SHMCB remove operation is performed under mutual
exclusion to prevent an inter-process synchronization problem. This release
makes sure that mod_ssl does not segfault if SCOREBOARD_SIZE is less than
1024. An SDBM patch has been merged in that fixes a problem with the sdbms
.dir file which arrises when a second .dir block is needed for the first
time.

[058] - Organon 0.5.1 (Stable)
  by Basilios (http://freshmeat.net/users/basilios/)
  Friday, February 1st 2002 06:27

Software Development Software Development :: Build Tools

About: Organon is a project manager that uses the Perl/Tk module. It is
written for those who use stand-alone editors to write their code but would
like to have a tool to manage the file groups they work with. It can be
used with any programming language, and it can be easily tailored to match
your needs. You can configure the standard tools (dedicated to editing,
compilation, and execution), and you can define any number of new user
tools. Each tool (standard or user-defined) is associated with a string
containing shell commands to be executed. 

Changes: Organon can now run projects and execute tools in a terminal
window. The terminal emulator can be defined in the Configure Standard
Tools dialog. The way to define Organon's behavior when capturing stdout
and stderr for standard and user-defined tools is now more flexible: there
is a drop-down menu instead of a group of checkboxes. Finally, the "--path"
command-line switch can now be used to choose a path in which to open the
first project of the session.

mesh plots, bar charts, and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or
different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
graph. Different line styles, widths, and colors are supported. A virtually
infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used. There are
almost 1,000 characters in the extended character set, including four
different fonts, the Greek alphabet, and a host of mathematical, musical,
and other symbols. The fonts can be scaled to any desired size. A variety
of output devices and file formats are supported, including a metafile
format which can be subsequently rendered to any device/file. New devices
and file formats can be easily added by writing a driver routine. 

Changes: This release works on a wide variety of platforms. There are good
reports for Windows systems (98, NT, and 2000), Mac OS X, several Unix
systems, and of course for Linux. It also has expanded examples, improved
documentation, dynamically loadable device drivers (including a new
Computer Graphics Metafile driver), and experimental versions of an image
plotting function, a PyQT GUI, and a Java front end.

[079] - Vstr string library 0.7.2
  by Nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  Friday, February 1st 2002 02:16

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. It works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la "C strings". It can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

Changes: This release adds some extra functions, including vstr_split()
which works similar to perl split() (although no regexp), functions to
parse numbers from a string, and "shortcut" functions for
mapping/reading/writing fds with the string.  Some extra examples were also
added, including an "nl" command.

an extranet, WebGUI  has something to offer. 

Changes: This release adds a Download Manager widget, a file typing system,
a mod_perl preload script to lessen memory usage and add database
connection pooling, several enhancements to the SQL Report, a PageTitle
macro, an Include macro, an Execute macro, support for mod_rewrite, and an
image management system. There are also a few minor improvements and bug
fixes.

How to Build a Beowulf
by Rajarshi Guha (http://freshmeat.net/~rajarshi/)
Section: Book Reviews
Saturday, March 9th 2002 00:00

I've set up two Beowulfs so far, and in both cases it involved gathering
material from various Web sites and somehow putting it all together. I got
everything up and running, but it was quite a "time sink" for me, so I was
interested to receive a book entitled "How to Build a Beowulf".  Finally,
information regarding Beowulfs would be available in one place and I could
save my bandwidth for other stuff!

logins via RSA were added to the server. libArianneClient was added so all
the calls the client could need are in this class, making the creation of a
new Arianne client simple. The current client can still only perform a set
of predefined actions that show off the engine.

  by Viraj Alankar (http://freshmeat.net/users/valankos/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 16:03

Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: CG_spam_filter.pl provides a content filter program for the Stalker
CommuniGate Pro mail server that seeks to limit the number of outgoing spam
your local users can send. In essence, it is a throttling script that
starts rejecting mail sent by your local users once they reach a certain
threshold (X messages or recipients per minute). It is difficult to catch
spammers until after the fact (when they have already done lots of damage
and spammed many users); this is simply an effort to stop them in their
tracks in real-time so you can deal with them later. 

Changes: Throttling based on repeat occurrence of a subject was added. SQL
queries were split up instead of using joins. Some minor bugs were fixed.

  Saturday, March 9th 2002 06:37

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Common C++ is a highly portable C++ class library meant primarily
for the development of portable threaded applications. A separate source
tree is maintained for both pthread "POSIX" targets (Linux, xBSD, Solaris,
etc), and for Win32 targets. The goal is to provide a truly common C++
framework for writing portable threaded applications that do not require a
huge amount of runtime overhead to support, and hence can make C++ and
threads suitable even for the development of trivial servers and
applications.

Changes: Fixes in URL get for ccAudio URLs that do file manipulations, in
xml.cpp (for gcc 3.x support), for the exception header check bug, for bugs
related to newer versions of autoconf and automake, and for 64-bit MD5s
were added. An interface binding patch is included.

  Saturday, March 9th 2002 03:27

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: cwebldap is a CGI program written in ANSI C which uses the LDAP API
to allow web clients to query an LDAP directory. It uses a configuration
file to determine what to  display from the directory. The configuration
file allows you to set maximum result set size, schema information, binding
information, and LDAP server information.

Changes: Improvements were added to the data structure code. A segfault on
null values, handling of attributes with multiple values, and a minor
memory leak in the data structures were fixed. Email addresses stored in
the standard schema are no longer linked with mailto.

  Saturday, March 9th 2002 03:28

Communications :: Email Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse (DCC) is a system of clients and
servers that collect and count checksums related to mail messages. The
counts can be used by SMTP servers and mail user agents to detect and
reject bulk mail. DCC servers can exchange common checksums. The checksums
include values that are "fuzzy", or constant across common variations in
bulk messages. 

Changes: Compression in the database was improved and the bandwidth
required for flooding was reduced.

  Saturday, March 9th 2002 23:08

Text Processing Utilities

About: Enca determines encoding of text files, provided you tell it their
language. Then it can convert them to other encodings, allowing you to
recode files without knowing their current encoding. It supports Czech,
Russian, and Slovak encodings. 

Changes: A fix for the built-in convertor converting only the first 64kB of
a file.

[019] - Enterprise Object Broker 0.30 (Development)
  by Paul Hammant (http://freshmeat.net/users/paulhammant/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 08:17

Software Development :: Object Brokering

About: Enterprise Object Broker (EOB) is an application server that
transparently distributes Java objects via their interfaces. Because of
this EOB makes no distinction between Local and Remote objects, hence is
not J2EE compliant. The developer builds beans that implement normal Java
interfaces and the deployer decides where the beans are in a cluster of
servers. AltRMI is used in place of RMI. It publishes plain interfaces
locally and remotely. The interfaces do not have to extend the Remote
interface. Methods do not have to throw RemoteException. EOB sits on top of
Apache's Avalon-Phoenix server platform. 

Changes: This release adds an example that uses ForumDemo from Velocity and
a binary download (showing only the forum demo) for those with short
attention spans, so they can launch EOB and point a browser at the pages it
serves.

[020] - GNOME Installation Guide 03/2002
  by karsten reincke (http://freshmeat.net/users/reincke/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 08:25

Desktop Environment :: Gnome

About: The GNOME Installation Guide was written to help unfamiliar users
install a stable GNOME system that includes more than the default
applications.  It teaches readers how to compile GNOME on their own instead
of installing precompiled packages.  It also covers installation of extra
GNOME programs, both those hosted by the GNOME project and those which are
not. 

Changes: Beside the update of the description of many of the GNOME 1.4.1
applications, a new installation guide for GNOME 2.0 has been added. This
new guide is completed by a review which is titled "Why I probably won't
directly upgrade onto GNOME 2.0 or Why normal users perhaps will be
disappointed by GNOME 2.0".

[023] - GNU gengetopt 2.6
  by Peter Koczan (http://freshmeat.net/users/tobo/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 06:42

Software Development Utilities

About: gengetopt takes an easy-to-do description of options and generates a
C function that uses the GNU getopt_long(3) function to parse the options
and validate them. gengetopt is GNU software, but the code generated is not
under any particular license. gengetopt is perfect if you are too lazy to
write all the stuff required to call GNU getopt_long(3), or if you have a
program and wish it took many options. The generated code works if you use
autoconf or automake.

Changes: Defaults are now used for func-name and file-name, the empty line
at the end of the .ggo file is no longer required, and an update for
gengetopt_count_line within TOK_MLSTRING was added. A much more modern
version was taken from the GNU C library.

[024] - GNUnilink 1.6
  by Simon Wood (http://freshmeat.net/users/mungewell/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 08:24

About: GNUnilink is a PIC adaptor that emulates a Sony Auto CD
Multichanger, enabling the AUX input on the rear of suitable Sony car
radios. This in turns allows the owner of such a radio to use these inputs
for a portable CD or MP3 player. GNUnilink contains an optional serial link
between PIC and PC.  Button presses can be sent to the PC.  The PC can set
disk/track numbers/names and provide a real-time counter.

Changes: Big changes to the layout of the file (and hopefully not too any
bugs) have been added.  The project is now split into a series of files to
make editing easier.  MiniDisk emulation has been started, although this
does not appear to work with the author's head unit.  Serial input has been
adjusted to allow for up to 255 tracks when in MiniDisk mode.  The
receiving code has been improved to handle commands of all lengths; this is
required to process the medium and long commands. The output serial names
have been changed to be more generic.  Some general formating and code
optimizations have been added.

[033] - lin-setibuf 1.8.2
  by Emmanuele Bassi (http://freshmeat.net/users/zefram/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 12:13

About: Lin-SETIBuf creates a stack of Work Units for the SETI@Home Project
text client, and then elaborates them sequentially, thus reducing the spare
time between them. It also displays the actual status of each Work Unit in
the stack, permits modification of the stack dimension on-the-fly, and
allows elaboration or download of only one Work Unit. 

Changes: This release fixes bugs in the --add and --proxy options; users
could use Lin-setibuf's variables while defining other variables or
metacommands in the last release.  The --cycle option now begins the stack
run anew.  The internals have been reviewed.  A contrib/ directory has been
created for scripts/add-ons.  Parallel download is now used for work units.

About: Mp3Kult is an application for KDE 2. It organizes your MP3/Ogg
collection in a MySQL database. It can read MP3/Ogg tags and song
information (length, bit rate, sample rate, etc.), make playlists, play
songs with an external player (xmms, gqmpeg), find a song in database (base
and advanced search), and make a copy of a playlist on your hard disk (to
play the playlist without inserting CDROMs). Mp3Kult can recursivly scan
directories to find MP3/Ogg files, and it can automatically mount, umount,
and eject a CDROM before/after a job. 

Changes: Support for Ogg files was added, although the editor for Ogg tags
isn't implemented yet. selection mode was updated, and selection with the
Ctrl key now works. History and completion mode were added in the "Add Mp3"
and "Add Volume" windows. Both the text and numeric versions of the genre
is now written in ID3 v2.x tags. The previous version read and wrote only a
number for the genre. The length calculations for VBR MP3s were corrected.
The ability to search through closed volumes in tree view mode. Database
creation can now be performed from within Mp3Kult itself, without using the
mp3kultdb script.

[056] - Topal 0.6.0
  by Phil Brooke (http://freshmeat.net/users/philb328/)
  Saturday, March 9th 2002 15:13

Communications :: Email

About: Topal is yet another program that links GnuPG and Pine. It offers
facilities to encrypt, decrypt, sign, and verify messages. Multiple PGP
blocks included in the text of a message are processed. Decryption and
verification output can be cached to reduce the number of times the
passphrase is entered. RFC2015 multipart messages can be sent and received
with help from some scripts, procmail, and a patch to Pine. There is a high
level of configurability.  

Changes: Support for RFC2015 multipart messages (requires a patch to Pine
for sending, and help from a script and procmail for receiving), a
pre-built binary that is statically linked against the GNAT stuff so that
people don't need to acquire GNAT first,  nd a new ability to send and
receive (deprecated) application/pgp messages.

[001] - 3dDesktop 0.1.2
  by Brad Wasson (http://freshmeat.net/users/bwasson/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 15:26

Desktop Environment Desktop Environment :: Gnome

About: 3d Destkop is an OpenGL program for switching virtual desktops in a
seamless 3-dimensional manner. The current desktop is mapped into a 3D
space where you may choose other screens. Several different visualization
modes are available.  

Changes: Compile time OpenGL detection has been switched to ac_opengl.  CPU
hogging has been reduced.  A semaphore has been added to avoid more then
one instance running at a time. A "Carousel" mode has been added, and it is
the default. The texture for digit 10 is now showing.  A flag to specify
the delay for random movements has been added.

[002] - AutoRPM 2.5
  by Kirk Bauer (http://freshmeat.net/users/kirkbauer/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 04:16

System :: Archiving :: Packaging System :: Software Distribution System ::
Software Distribution Tools

About: AutoRPM is a program that can do any combination  of the following:
mirror RPMs from an FTP site, keep  installed RPMs consistent with an FTP
site or local  directory and keep installed RPMs in a cluster or  network
of systems consistent. It is highly flexible  and contains a fully
command-line driven  interactive install mode (for installing RPMs from the
 queue or for installing RPMs from your system  interactively). It also
handles recursive  dependencies. 

Changes: Dependency following (within interactive queues), consistent
architecture handling, the ability to handle multiple remote versions of
RPMs correctly, and bugfixes were added.

[003] - AutoUpdate 3.5.3
  by Gerald Teschl (http://freshmeat.net/users/gtesiacat/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 13:39

System :: Archiving :: Packaging System :: Systems Administration

About: AutoUpdate is a simple Perl script which performs a task similar to
Red Hat's up2date or autorpm. It can be used to automatically download and
upgrade RPMs from different FTP sites. Moreover, it can also be used to
keep a server with a customized (Red Hat) distribution plus all clients up
to date.

Changes: Autoupdate should work under older Perl versions again.

[004] - bash programmable completion 20020402
  by Ian Macdonald (http://freshmeat.net/users/ianmacd/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 06:23

System :: Shells Utilities

About: Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and
extend its standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines
with just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to
complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3 str
[Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX
manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems
from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all targets
in Makefile. This project was conceived to produce programmable completion
routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the amount of
typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis. 

Changes: Long option completion for netstat was added, as was renice(8)
completion. A bug in dpkg-reconfigure completion was fixed. sudo and other
commands that perform command completion now perform correctly when
wildcards in their parameters are expanded. 'cvs commit' now defaults to
local file completion instead of remote repository completion. Remote
completion errors in scp completion are now silently discarded.

[009] - Cfour 1.0 beta4 (CFfile class)
  by Jeffrey Bakker (http://freshmeat.net/users/staeryatz/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 03:16

Software Development

About: Cfour provides C++ Common Console Classes that  are reusable, for
console I/O, _easy_ file I/O, and a  class for managing configuration files
using an XML  style format. Cfour currently remains OS  independent. The
Cfour classes were used in parts  of webcpp and mkscs. 

Changes: The overloaded insertion and extraction operators can now handle
multiple streams through one call. An openW() method that never (or always)
overwrites rather than prompting, an rfile() method that reads the open
file into a string, get and set file pointer methods, and defined file open
modes were added. All templated methods are now implemented in the header
to avoid linker errors with the Microsoft compiler.

Chemistry

About: Cyberbrau is a Web-based program to help the homebrewer. It allows
for very simple and intuitive beer, cider, and mead recipe creation, and it
automatically calculates all the pertinent information based on the
selected ingredients and schedule. In addition to the recipes, it allows
multiple brewers to privately track their own batches, emailing them on
racking, bottling, and lagering dates. Finally, it has a 'taster's review'
section which allows those who try your brew to rate and comment on the
batch. This information goes into the overall recipe ranking.  

Changes: Many new bugfixes and ergonomic enhancements, a few security
fixes, inclusion of a new, optional BBS to mimic www.cyberbrau.org's
functionality, a new admin section to create/admin all the beer styles,
user accounts, etc., and many little improvements all around.

Text Editors :: Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

About: David is a C/C++ code editor for GNOME. It pretends to be a
complement to Glade, so it doesn't include an environment for GUI's
development. It has neither a debugger or other kind of tool to help
debugging. The idea is for it to be a light code editor that doesn't need
too many resources, and makes use of external tools (gcc, glade, ddd, etc.)
for some tasks. 

Changes: New functionality to the functions tag, a new combo functions
list, changing the messages shown when executing make, a new menu launcher
for Memprof, a new option to link with electric-fence, a menu launcher for
the project's binary, modifications to use and generate configure.in, new
tags in almost everything, modifying configure.in to be more portable,
completion of the icon set, and some bugfixes.

  by Yves Mettier (http://freshmeat.net/users/ymettier/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 15:23

System :: Archiving

About: GTKtalog is made to easily browse a CD-ROM database. Each disk,
folder and file has a size, date, category, description, and content
parameter and can be completely edited or deleted. The file search module
can do searches on filename, foldername with name, category description,
date, filesize, and content parameter. Each filetype has its own icon. It
possible to use programs like tar, arj, zip, or scripts to extract
information from files to include in the database. Gtktalog can mount,
scan, umount, and eject a CD-ROM in the background.

Changes: Ogg Vorbis files are scanned for information if ogginfo is
installed.  The progress bar works better when scanning a disk (CD scanning
bar was working).

[037] - Infinite Monkey - Native Java SecureRandom 1.0

Security Security :: Cryptography Software Development :: Libraries :: Java
Libraries

About: Infinite Monkey - Native Java SecureRandom is an   implementation of
a Java SecureRandom provider.  The default implementation of SecureRandom
in  most  JDKs spins up an enormous number of  threads and  uses that to
seed the random number  generator,  taking quite some time. Infinite 
Monkey - Native  Java SecureRandom skips the  lengthy non-native  seeding
process by letting the  underlying operating  system provide the 
randomness. Under Windows this is done through a  call to the CryptoAPI
using JNI, and under UNIX the  randomness is fetched from /dev/urandom.

Changes: The image file export was changed to the Java Advanced Imaging
Library part of the JDK 1.4. This streamlined the whole shebang.
Additionally, the function plotter was partially redesigned to use a real
Java expression parser, which speeds things up a bit.  Some small changes
were made in the API.

Changes: The pre 1.4 JDK releases have very limited image encoding
abilities. As such, this release remains focused on JPEG and PNG encoding,
which should suffice for most applications. GIF encoding has been removed
due to licensing problems.  In any other regards, this branch is completely

basicly a port of the KDE2 version, but the FTP/SMB VFS was rewritten, so
it's not as well tested as the KDE2 version.

Communications :: Usenet News

About: Newsstar fetches news and posts it to a local news server: INN,
s-news, and sn are supported. What makes newsstar special is that it can
make multiple simultaneous connections, not only to one server, but to
several, supporting up to 10 "threads". Before fetching each article, it
checks that it hasn't already been downloaded by another thread or in a
previous session. It can also "pipeline" article requests to make better
use of available bandwidth.  

Changes: The display of the number of articles downloaded has been
improved.  The README has heading numbers.  A problem discarding duplicates
from the end of a group has been fixed.

Security :: Cryptography System :: Networking

About: The SLAN project is focused on developing a flexible open source
Virutal Private Networking system, primarily for securing Internet uplinks
which use broadcast media such as 802.11 wireless links or public/shared
ethernets. The system is flexible enough to support traditional VPN
applications as well. As well as featuring an open design and strong
security, the SLAN project hopes to eventually provide support for all
major computing platforms.  

Changes: A design change from a layer 3 tunneling protocol to layer 2,
allowing the server to join its virtual network clients to the LAN with a
bridge instead of using routing or network address translation, replacing
the buggy SLAN kernel driver with the Universal TUN/TAP driver that is
typically included in Linux-2.4 kernel, a rewrite for the control channel
TCP code, several bugfixes and code cleanups, and temporary removal of
Windows support code.

guess the smartcard's size, wiping the identity instead of just unlinking
it, and fixes for some small bugs.

[102] - Wellenreiter 0.9
  by Max Moser (http://freshmeat.net/users/max1111/)
  Tuesday, April 2nd 2002 05:55

Communications Internet Security

About: Wellenreiter is a GTK/Perl program that makes the discovery and
auditing of 802.11b wireless networks much easier. It has an embedded
statistics engine for the common parameters provided by wireless drivers,
enabling you to view details about the consistency and signal strength of
the network. Its scanner window can be used to discover access-points,
networks, and ad-hoc cards. It detects essid broadcasting or
non-broadcasting networks in every channel, the manufacturer, WEP, and
automatically-switching frequencies. A flexible sound event configuration
lets you work in unattended environments. A logwindow helps to track the
net scanning. A ethereal / tcpdump compatible dumpfile can be created for
the whole session, so detailed analysis at another location is easy.
Wellenreiter can reside on low-resolution devices that can run GTK/Perl and
Linux/BSD (such as iPaqs).

Changes: The ability to add, edit and delete custom comments for each
accesspoint, a popup menu with the detailview of an accesspoint, an
accoustic_events subroutine, dumpfile support allowing you to dump your
whole scan to a pcap dumpfile, support for disabling automatic
channelswitching, modifications to the default startsniff command, and a
new log window that makes it more easier to track the timeline were added.
The "detected by Frametype" accesspoints detail view was removed. All
capture 802.11b frames are now dumped. The the manufacturer detection was
corrected.

The Book of Linux Music and Sound
by jeff covey (http://freshmeat.net/~jeffcovey/)
Section: Book Reviews
Saturday, May 18th 2002 00:00

Musicians aren't always technically inclined. When they look for music
software to run on their computers, they're apt to buy something for the
Windows system they already have or believe the advice that anything
artistic is supposed to be done an a Mac. Linux systems provide cheap and
powerful alternatives, and this book tells you how to get started with
them.

Desktop Environment :: Gnome Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: The Bubbling Load Monitor (or "Bubblemon" for short) is a system CPU
and memory load monitor for the GNOME panel. It looks like a vial
containing water. The water level indicates how much (electronic) memory is

amount of bubbles reflects the system CPU load.

Changes: Portability between desktop environments has been much improved by
separating the sources into platform-dependent and platform-independent
files. The GNOME port has been rewritten from scratch, which should solve
all reported display problems.

  by Ben Martin (http://freshmeat.net/users/monkeyiq/)
  Saturday, May 18th 2002 22:35

Software Development :: Libraries System :: Filesystems

About: libferris is a virtual filesystem that exposes hierarchical data of
all kinds through a common C++ interface. Access to data is performed using
C++ IOStreams and Extended Attributes (EA) can be attached to each datum to
present metadata. Ferris uses a plugin API to read various data sources and
expose them as contexts and to generate interesting EA. Current
implementations include Native (kernel disk IO with event updates using
fam), xml (mount an xml file as a filesystem), edb (mount a berkeley
database), ffilter (mount an LDAP filter string) and mbox (mount your
mailbox). EA generators include image, audio, and animation decoders. 

Changes: A fix for a too-high reference count for IOStreams, calling read()
on a context keeps stateful EA attached, a new CursorAPI for maintaining a
cursor on a collection of subcontexts, a new ClipAPI for file-clipboard://
actions with cursor support and undo/redo capability, and new clients for
ClipAPI (fclipcopy, fclipcut, fclippaste, fclipredo, and fclipundo). Note
that the file-clipboard:// history can also be mounted as a filesystem.

[046] - PLP 3.10
  by Juerd (http://freshmeat.net/users/Juerd/)
  Saturday, May 18th 2002 08:19

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content Software Development ::
Interpreters

About: PLP is yet another Perl embedder, primarily for HTML documents.
Unlike with other Perl embedders, there is no need to learn a meta-syntax
or object model: one can just use the normal Perl constructs. PLP runs
under mod_perl for speeds comparable to those of PHP, but can also be run
as a CGI script.

Changes: This release adds a standardized module distribution (to allow
easy distribution via CPAN), comments for PLP hackers in PLP.pm, mod_perl
handler() for extremely easy installation, and some documentation (perldoc
PLP) with installation instructions. All the code has moved from plp.cgi to
PLP.pm.

[065] - wingS 1.0-beta1
  by Henner Zeller (http://freshmeat.net/users/hzeller/)
  Saturday, May 18th 2002 06:11

Software Development

About: wingS is a servlet development framework for Web applications. It
features Swing-like components and utilizes Swing models, Swing events, and
a very similar API. A special LayoutManager allows you to place components
using designer provided HTML templates. The HTML code generation of the
components themself supports PLAF (Pluggable Look and Feel), so it is
possible to create a different output, like plain HTML, HTML+CSS, and WML.

Changes: The API has been stabilized so that no more API changes are
expected before 1.0 final release. Rendering has been improved in a way
that allows more HTML-Attributes to be set programatically or from the
template layout. With a factory pattern, you can create PLAF (Pluggable
Look and Feel) and output encodings (such as gzipped output streams) on
demand, depending on the browser. Many bugs have also been fixed.

[008] - bash programmable completion 20020611
  by Ian Macdonald (http://freshmeat.net/users/ianmacd/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 16:18

System :: Shells
System :: Systems Administration
Utilities

About: Since v2.04, bash has allowed you to intelligently program and
extend its standard completion behavior to achieve complex command lines
with just a few keystrokes. Imagine typing ssh [Tab] and being able to
complete on hosts from your ~/.ssh/known_hosts files. Or typing man 3 str
[Tab] and getting a list of all string handling functions in the UNIX
manual. mount system: [Tab] would complete on all exported file-systems
from the host called system, while make [Tab] would complete on all
targets in Makefile. This project was conceived to produce programmable
completion routines for the most common Linux/UNIX commands, reducing the
amount of typing sysadmins and programmers need to do on a daily basis. 

Changes: $BASH_COMPLETION_DIR was accidentally set to /etc/bash_completion
instead of /etc/bash_completion.d. In tar completion, completing on files
within a tar file would consume all memory in bash 2.05a, due to a known
bug in bash. This is now worked around.

About: Bioperl is set of Perl Modules for bioinformatics. It contains
objects for Sequences, features on Sequences, and other important
bioinformatics attributes.

Changes: This is a bugfix release. Improvements were made to BLAST and
FASTA parsing in the Bio::Search modules. Several small bugs that were
discovered by 1.0 users have been fixed. No API changes were made that
would prevent scripts written for 1.0 from working with 1.0.1.

Communications :: Email
Communications :: Email :: Filters
Security

About: Blackhole Spam/Virus Filter provides spam and virus filtering using
dot-files in all the major MTA/SMTP servers for UNIX and similar systems.
It is easy for an individual user to set it up with shell account access
and configure. It is different from other, similar programs, in that it
executes a minimal number of programs to do the filtering, is able to use
a MySQL database for the users' configuration files, can be set up as the
queue in Qmail, and have virtual users' configuration files be found using
the username/domain for the recipient. Multiple checks are available, and
there open options on how to treat flagged email. There is logging to
multiple entities, auto-expiration of flagged email, and scoring available
so that multiple checks require matches that add up before blocking. 

Changes: A code cleanup to allow for statistic collection for email
traffic in the future, and other minor cleanups.

  by saberworks (http://freshmeat.net/users/massassi/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 14:21

Software Development :: Libraries :: PHP Classes

About: bTemplate is a PHP class that facilitates the  separation of PHP
code and various markup  languages (HTML, XML, etc.). It provides simple 
variable interpolation, loops, complex (nested)  loops, simple
conditionals, and case loops. By  default, it uses XML compatible syntax,
but the  opening and closing tags can be customized.

Changes: This version introduces a new case loop syntax, an optional
second argument to the constructor (whether to reset template variables
after a fetch() call), and a reset_vars() method that allows you to
manually reset template variables. The documentation has been updated to
include all features, and the bTemplate Web site has benchmarks that
compare bTemplate to various other template systems.

Software Development :: Bug Tracking

About: Bug Traction is a Web-based bug tracking system written in Perl
with DBI. It is based on Bugtrack, but adds a number of features. It
should work in all situations where Bugtrack works, but there are features
that have been added (such as attachments) that may not yet work with any
database backend other than MySQL. In all other respects, Bug Traction is
true to the Bugtrack heritage which it shares and should work on a variety
of platforms and with a variety of database backends.

Changes: All known bugs have been fixed. The last operation report on bugs
is now displayed. Project Status editing has been restored and enhanced.
URL management and user messaging was added. Per-user configuration
options (vacation mode and bug list size) were enhanced, and users can be
marked 'assignable'. Bugs can now be marked with a target release version.
All users are encouraged to upgrade to 1.2.

Software Development
Software Development :: Quality Assurance

About: Codestriker is a Perl CGI script that is used for performing code
reviews in a collaborative fashion, as opposed to using patches sent in
unstructured emails. Authors create code review topics, and the nominated
reviewers are automatically notified by email. Reviewers can view the
proposed diff in plain text mode, coloured-diff mode, and can also view
the original and new files that comprise the review in their entirety when
Codestriker is linked with CVS. Comments are made on a per-line basis, and
comments submitted by the other reviewers can be viewed as they are
created. Emails are sent to the appropriate parties when comments are
created. The author is free to submit comments against the review
comments. The end result is a structured set of review comments instead of
a pile of unstructured emails. Codestriker also features the ability to
search over existing topics in a variety of ways.  

Changes: Codestriker has been restructured into a number of Perl modules.
Codestriker's data is now stored into a database using DBI, supporting
PostgreSQL, MySQL and other databases. It is now possible to list the
current topics in the system, and to filter by topic state. It is also
possible to search over all topics in the system, in a large number of
ways. Comments are now entered via a popup window, so that the view topic
screen is not reloaded after each comment, making reviews far more
bandwidth friendly.

Security :: Cryptography

About: Gringotts is a small utility that allows you to jot down sensitive
data (passwords, credit card numbers, PINs, etc.) in an easy-to-read,
easy-to-access, and most of all very secure form. Gringotts makes use of
the MCrypt and MHash libraries for encryption, and uses GTK+ 2 for the
user interface. It lets the user choose from among eight strong encryption
algorithms (RIJNDAEL-128, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT, TWOFISH, CAST-256,
SAFER+, LOKI97, 3DES), two hashing algorithms (SHA1, RIPEMD 160) and two
compression techniques (ZLib and BZip2) with four compression ratios.
Moreover, it allows the user to use any file as a password, as an
alternative to the usual text string, giving additional choices.

Changes: When an entry was repositioned via the list dialog, it overwrote
the other entries it shifted in the operation. This has been fixed.

  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 14:20

About: Keso is an editor for scores and orchestras. Or,  more precisely, a

write music in  patterns, and arrange those patterns in sequences.  It
will produce orchestra and score files that can  be played or rendered by
Csound. The user  interface consists of different editors. Each editor  is
a plugin that can be removed or replaced, and  new editors can be added
while the program is  running. 

Changes: Almost all the code from 0.2 has been moved to a shared library,
which is used by a new GUI program (based on gtkmm). There are GUI editors
for the orchestra, the patterns, the sequences, and the ftables. It is
still a bit rough, but now it is possible to generate Csound files. There
are no instruments included in this release though.

  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 13:16

Database
Database :: Front-Ends
System :: Archiving :: Backup

About: MySQL Backup is a Perl script that uses mysqlshow to grab the
database names and "show tables" to grab the table names for a user's
account, and then uses mysqldump to save the data in a subdirectory named
in the script. It then tars and gzips the files, using the date and time
for the file name. It can be run from cron on a daily basis. It removes
old files and has an option to email the gzip file to an admin, and/or FTP
the file to a remote server. It also has options to use "select data into
outfile" or a regular "select" for users who can't use mysqldump. It
supports LARGE sets of databases and tables. 

Changes: A small bugfix (comments are required in front of 'use'
statements for Net::FTP and MIME::Lite if those libraries aren't
installed), and some code and instructions have been reworked.

  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 11:15

Communications :: Chat :: Internet Relay Chat

About: NeoBOPM is a modified version of BOPM, which acts as a server on a
IRC network instead of a client. It scans clients for open proxies
(commonly used to attack IRC network with floodbots) as they connect to a
IRC network and will Akill the host if its an open proxy. The advantage of
running this as a server instead of as a bot is that it can scan all
connections on a network, and not just local connections. NeoBOPM scans
for open HTTP, SOCKS 4/5, and Wingate proxies as well as insecure Cisco
routers. 

Changes: This release has been fully tested with the Ultimate3.x.x series
of IRCDs, but should also work with most Bahamut-based IRCDs.

Additionally, PHP Auth includes support for user registration and
user-level and admin-level account administration (change username,

database functionality is completely abstracted away from the rest of the
code, so changes for other database systems should be trivial.

  by icculus (http://freshmeat.net/users/icculus/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 06:17

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Filesystems

About: PhysicsFS is a library to provide abstract access to  various
archives. The programmer defines a "write  directory" on the physical
filesystem. No file writing  done through the PhysicsFS API can leave that
 write directory, for security. For file reading, the  programmer lists
directories and archives that form  a "search path". Once the search path
is defined, it  becomes a single, transparent, hierarchical  filesystem.
This makes for easy access to ZIP files  in the same way as you access a
file directly on  the disk, and it makes it easy to ship a new archive 
that will override a previous archive on a per-file  basis. Symbolic links
can be disabled, for added  safety. Finally, PhysicsFS gives you a
platform- abstracted means to determine if CD-ROMs are  available, the
user's home directory, where in the  real filesystem your program is
running, etc. 

Changes: This release uses the GNU autoconf/automake build system and
includes zlib 1.1.4 with the source for platforms that need it. Also added
was an API for determining a file's last modification time and a
quick-and-dirty HTTP server to demonstrate library usage. Doxygen can now
be used to generate man pages and an HTML reference. It should now be 100%
functional on Win32, BeOS, Solaris, MacOS X, and MacOS Classic.

  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 03:02

Database
Internet :: WWW/HTTP
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content

About: Redfoot is a framework for building distributed data-driven web
applications with RDF and Python. Redfoot includes an in-memory RDF
database, RDF parser and serializer, query API, templating language for
building RDF-driven web-sites, reusable module architecture and sample
modules (including schema-driven RDF editor module and RSS viewer module),
and the beginnings of a peer-to-peer architecture for communication
between Redfeet. 

Changes: There is now a remove and a remove_triples (no more overloaded
remove), layer 2 has been merged with layer 1 as there is no longer a need
for them to be separate layers, and the generate_uri method has moved to
LoadSave since triple stores do not have a notion of a URI. A bug was
fixed in node's n3 function, URI -> URIRef. String based exceptions were
replaced with class based exceptions, and a PyUnit test case for parser.py
was added, along with a N-Triples parser, and __len__ and __eq__ methods
to the store interface.

Software Development :: Code Generators
Software Development :: Quality Assurance

About: Refactorit is a powerful tool for Java developers who expect more
from their standard IDE. With Refactorit, a developer can take source code
of any size and complexity, and rework it into well-designed code by means
of automated refactorings such as Rename
Field/Method/Variable/Class/Package, Extract Method, Move Type,
Encapsulate Field, and Create Factory Method. In addition, Refactorit
provides a comprehensive set of smart query functions that make it
possible to analyze and track large volumes of code. Refactorit may be
used as standalone tool or installed as an add-in to IDEs like NetBeans,
Forte, JDeveloper, and JBuilder. 

Changes: Shortcuts can be defined for every action in NetBeans/Forte.
Extract Superclass can now make methods abstract on extract. Extract
Superclass now generates constructors when necessary. Where Used allows
you to perform searches on several objects at once, and lots of bugfixes
were made.

About: Todays applications tend to be skinnable: cdplayers, email
notifiers, even operating systems. SkinLF provides a skin system for Java
programs.

Changes: This release fixes an opacity bug with JLayeredPane. The shading
of InternalFrame in JDK1.4 was resizing the window to 0 pixels in height,
and JTable serialization was failing due to GtkPersonality not being

GtkListCellRenderer. DefaultButton images have been made transient too.
NativeSkin replaces SkinRegion, and is not only limited to irregular
windows (the library name has changed too).

  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 06:18

Security
System

About: Sophie is a daemon which uses 'libsavi' library from Sophos anti
virus vendor ( http://www.sophos.com ). On startup, Sophie initializes
SAPI (Sophos Anti-Virus Interface), loads virus patterns into memory,
opens local UNIX domain socket, and waits for someone to connect and
instructs it which path to scan. Since the database is loaded in RAM,
scanning is very fast. (Note: speed of scanning also depends on SAVI
settings and size of the file.) It works on Linux, Solaris (Sparc/x86),
HP-UX, and FreeBSD. It was made as a part of 'Virge' project, which is a
mail/attachment/virus scanning tool, written in C.

Changes: A major bug was fixed, where -HUP would not properly restart
Sophie if the network mode was not enabled.

installation of Linux, rescue disks, and other uses for boot floppies. A
SYSLINUX floppy can be manipulated using standard MS-DOS (or any other OS
that can access an MS-DOS filesystem) tools once it has been created, and
requires only a ~ 8K DOS program or ~ 16K Linux program to create it in
the first place. It also includes PXELINUX, a program to boot off a
network server using a boot PROM compatible with the Intel PXE
(Pre-Execution Environment) specification, ISOLINUX, a program to boot off
ISO 9660 CD-ROMs in native mode, and MEMDISK, a tool to boot legacy
operating systems (e.g. DOS) using a Linux boot loader regardless of
medium.

[124] - XStow 0.2.0
  by King Leo (http://freshmeat.net/users/kingleo/)
  Tuesday, June 11th 2002 20:06

System :: Installation/Setup
Utilities

About: XStow is a replacement for GNU Stow written in C++. It supports all
features of Stow with some extensions. XStow and GNU Stow are programs for
managing the installation of software packages. It keeps each package in
its own directory while making it appear that all packages are installed
in the same place. Unlike GNU Stow, XStow does not depend on Perl, and can
be compiled statically for such uses as rescue disks. XStow is fully
compatible with GNU Stow, meaning that you can switch from one to the
other at will. 

Changes: Traversable link support, which allows you to set a link from
/usr/share/man to /usr/man. The behavior can be configured via the
xstow.ini file.

[001] - Argo/UML 0.10.1
  by Thierry Lach (http://freshmeat.net/users/thierrylach/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 09:11

Text Editors :: Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

About: Argo/UML is a pure Java open source CASE tool that provides
cognitive support for object-oriented design. Argo/UML provides some of
the same editing and code generation features of a commercial CASE tool,
but it focuses on features that enhance usability and support the
cognitive needs of designers. Uses XML file formats: XMI and PGML. 

Changes: This is a bugfix release for version 0.10. The following problems
have been solved: Information about hiding of
(attribute|operation)-compartment of a class were lost during a
save-open-cycle. Deployment diagrams did not save/load properly. The
sequence diagram locked up the corresponding problem for deployment
diagrams.

ST, Mac, and Linux/UNIX. It includes support for Atari cartridge ROMs,
popular Atari disk images files, running Atari binaries directly from the
host system, and accessing the host filesystem from within the emulated
Atari. 

Changes: This release features changes to the command-line options,
support for emulating 16K models, LPTjoy joystick support (Linux), man
page updates, high-speed disk I/O emulation, and an implementation of a
"Dirty" screen update scheme. 2nd joystick button support for the Atari
5200 was fixed, M68K port updates and fixes were made, and emulation for
the Trak-Ball and light gun was added. Many miscellaneous code cleanups
and bugfixes were also made.

[007] - BlackHole Spam/Virus Filter 0.9.107 (Stable)

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 00:13

Communications :: Email
Communications :: Email :: Filters
Security

About: Blackhole Spam/Virus Filter provides spam and virus filtering using
dot-files in all the major MTA/SMTP servers for UNIX and similar systems.
It is easy for an individual user to set it up with shell account access
and configure. It is different from other, similar programs, in that it
executes a minimal number of programs to do the filtering, is able to use
a MySQL database for the users' configuration files, can be set up as the
queue in Qmail, and have virtual users' configuration files be found using
the username/domain for the recipient. Multiple checks are available, and
there open options on how to treat flagged email. There is logging to
multiple entities, auto-expiration of flagged email, and scoring available
so that multiple checks require matches that add up before blocking. 

Changes: String handling was improved, giving both security and
performance gains, and some double checking of strings was added in order
to avoid possible security problems.

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 12:41

Communications :: Chat :: Internet Relay Chat

About: bobot++ is an IRC bot written in C++. Being the evolution of bobot,
it provides time dependent commands, multichannel, flood control and many
other features.

Changes: This is the last stable release before 2.0. There are no new
features in this version, just code cleanups. When Guile 1.6 is released,
this will become 2.0 unless bug reports are filed.

[009] - Calculating Pi Second Release (Brute Force Method)
  by Sayan Chakraborti (http://freshmeat.net/users/sayanchak/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 09:49

Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics
Scientific/Engineering :: Visualization

About: ProjectPi is a project to calculate the mathematical constant Pi
through various methods. 

Changes: This version uses a brute force mechanism which calculates the
area of a circle and divides it by r^2. This release completes with far
fewer iterations than the previous release, since it uses an
antidifferentiated version of the formula that computes the area. Note
that dx=1, so a radius much larger than 1 is required for good results.

  by ronnocol (http://freshmeat.net/users/ronnocol/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 00:32

System :: Networking
System :: Networking :: Monitoring

About: cdpr (Cisco Discovery Protocol Reporter) shows the switch and port
that a machine is connected to, provided that the device supports CDP. It
can also optionally decode the full CDP packet. cdpr was written to help
network/system administrators find out about the equipment that a machine
is connected to. This is done by capturing and decoding a Cisco Discovery
Protocol (CDP) packet. 

Changes: This release handles errors returned during packet capture
better. Older versions could segfault while trying to decode a
'non-packet'.

[011] - cdrecord 1.11a26
  by Jrg Schilling (http://freshmeat.net/users/schily/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 04:34

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: CD Audio :: CD Ripping
Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: CD Audio :: CD Writing
System :: Archiving

About: Cdrecord creates home-burned CDs with a CD-R/CD-RW recorder. It
works as a burn engine for several applications. Cdrecord supports CD
recorders from many different vendors; all SCSI-3/mmc and ATAPI/mmc
compliant drives should also work. Supported features include IDE/ATAPI,
parallel-port, and SCSI drives, audio CDs, data CDs, and mixed CDs, full
multi-session support, CD-RWs (rewritable), TAO, DAO and human-readable
error messages. Cdrecord includes remote SCSI support and can access local
or remote CD-writers.

Changes: The data structures were modified to allow for new features in
the future. The speed= option no longer defaults to speed 1, but rather to
a drive-specific value that is maximum speed for modern drives. A new test
that prevents writing to CD-RW media too slowly was included, the DVD
write speed is now displayed correctly, and preparation has been made for
allowing the -dao option to work when writing DVDs. A bug that caused it
to complain when trying to write to CD-RW media at 10x or faster was also
fixed.

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 06:25

System :: Archiving :: Backup

About: dobackup.pl is a flexible Perl script to handle unattended
incremental backups of multiple servers. It handles multiple media sets
with automatic media preparation and rotation, configurable
'what-to-backup', global per-host exclusion patterns, and user settable

authoring; otherwise it is independent. It includes a forum, calendar,
event tracking, announcements, tasks, user management, email, and more.

Changes: This release has major bugfixes and feature enhancements. Major
changes are all-day/no end date events, pop-up Javascript calendars when
picking dates, organization and phone tracking for users, and elimination
bogus database entries. A bug when admins tried to delete a user has been
fixed. There is an updated README and code cleanup.

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 23:59

Database
Other/Nonlisted Topic
Text Processing :: Filters

About: DSML is the Directory Services Markup Language, an XML dialect for
working with directory information. The DSML Tools provide for the
querying of any LDAP directory (with search results output as DSML), the
importing of DSML data into any LDAP directory, the directory-context
validation of DSML (checking for illegal attributes in the entries, etc.),
and the calculation of the differences (for a directory) between two DSML
documents to provide an XML Diff algorithm for DSML data. This software
makes all LDAP-supporting directories DSML-enabled. It can also check the
integrity of DSML data, and show at a glance how two data sets,
represented as DSML, differ.

Changes: Xerces 2.0.2 is now used as the XML parser, as 1.3.0 is no longer
available or supported. Other tweaks include an "attributes only"
command-line option (-o), a few fixed NullPointerExceptions, and UTF8
output.

Changes: This release updates config help files, changes handling of tab
title padding, patches some memory leaks, removes dead code, and has other
behind the scenes changes. It also improves the look of tab/window title
padding.

Magellan unique functions, it is possible to include many elements in the
same page, while maintaining the same overall appearance.  

Changes: A relations class was added for compatibility with old modules
which rely on it. A lot of code was optimized by changing double quotes to
single quotes. Occurrences of "&" were changed to "&" in tag handlers in
order to validate the output code.

Communications :: Email :: Filters

About: MessageWall is an SMTP proxy. It sits between the outside world and
your mail server and keeps out viruses, spam, and mail relaying. It offers
filtering via header and body checks, DNS-based blacklists for IP
addresses (DNSBL) and domains (RHSBL), DNS-based distributed checksumming
(DNS DCC) similar to Vipul's Razor, and Open AntiVirus pattern scanning.
Unlike many existing ISP-level filtering solutions, it offers
customization of filtering features on a per-address basis. Unlike
SpamAssassin, it communicates via SMTP, so it works with any MTA. It also
supports scoring based on rules with a rejection threshold; this allows
hybrid warning/rejection configurations based on how many and which rules
a message matches.

Changes: Cleaned up the freeing of memory when clients are closed, and
fixed bugs in the parsing of invalid SMTP lines and SIGPIPE handling.

  by Marius Aamodt Eriksen (http://freshmeat.net/users/mae/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 12:44

About: Netics is an extensible network statistics collector. It puts the
network interface in promiscuous mode and reads the data stream (after it
strips off the appropriate protocol headers), then displays the results at
specified intervals, either in a "progress bar" mode or as raw statistics.
Currently, it supports 2 statistics, both involving entropy: LZW
compressability and Ueli Maurer's universal statistical test. Maurer's
test is a very good and comprehensive measure of entropy, but requires a
large amount of data. The LZW statistic requires much less data.

Changes: This release adds an Ueli Mauer scan, a progress bar, and a
generic interface.

[052] - PHP Auth 1.1 (Stable)
  by Michael Chaney (http://freshmeat.net/users/mdchaney/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 23:58

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: PHP Auth is a very flexible framework for PHP applications that is
loosely based on phplib. It requires PHP4 session support. The main
difference between PHP Auth and phplib is the improved auth class.
Additionally, PHP Auth includes support for user registration and
user-level and admin-level account administration (change username,
password, etc.). It currently has support only for MySQL, however, the
database functionality is completely abstracted away from the rest of the
code, so changes for other database systems should be trivial.

Changes: This version contains a very minor bugfix in register.php, and a
new class to provide an easy interface to authorize.net's service. There
are also a couple of new functions to validate the checksum and expiration
date of a credit card number, and a few more samples in the template
directory to help you get started with using curl or credit card
processing.

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 10:38

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers
Software Development :: Libraries
Software Development :: Libraries :: Application Frameworks

About: The C++ Portable Types Library (PTypes) is a simple alternative to
the STL that includes multithreading and networking. It defines dynamic
strings, character sets, lists, and other basic data types along with
threads, synchronization, and IP sockets. It is portable across modern
Unix and Windows systems, and includes a sample HTTP daemon showing the
full power of the library.

Changes: A big sample program called wshare is now included in the
project. Wshare is a simple and fast HTTP/1.1 web server which
demonstrates the full power of PTypes. Wshare currently lacks server-side
scripting functionality, but it can be used to quickly share local files
over the Web. Waiting for data with timeout on a socket object is
implemented (ipsocket::waitfor()). SIGPIPE is now blocked on Unix when
using PTypes' sockets. A bugfix was made for autofree threads. Please note
that the semantics of thread::waitfor() have changed.

  by Eduard Koucky (http://freshmeat.net/users/koucky/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 06:26

Internet :: WWW/HTTP

About: SAPRFC is the extension module for PHP4 that  allows call ABAP
functions in an SAP R/3 system  from PHP scripts. It is also possible to
write an RFC  server program in PHP, and call PHP functions from  ABAP.
Other features include using the RFC  (Remote Function Call) API to make a
call,  discovering the interface of a function module, and  mapping all
RFC types to PHP strings (delivered  with a test script that has a similar
function to  the "Single Test" option in the SE37 transaction). 

Changes: The offset position for structure fields in the internal buffer
is now determined from the OFFSET value returned by
RFC_GET_FUNCTION_INTERFACE_P. This resolves data corruption problems for
parameters or tables that have structures that include other structures,
such as the MARA table.

  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 12:17

Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content :: CGI Tools/Libraries

About: ThumbNails is an automated system for creating and maintaining web
sites containing large numbers of digital photographs or other images. It
will go through a group of directories filled with pictures, make
thumbnail images of each picture, make HTML pages for each directory
showing clickable thumbnails for each picture, and make an overall
index.html document for the HTML pages it creates. It can use a MySQL
database to hold picture titles, captions, and other information. The
database information can be edited over the web, and can be displayed
along with the pictures. It includes a daemon which periodically checks
the pictures directories and database (if used), updating the web site
automatically as needed.

Changes: This release improves site layout and user navigation. It can
create individual thumbnail HTML pages for one or all levels of picture
directories. It provides control for forward/reverse sorting the main
index, subdirectory image groups or links, and thumbnails on each HTML
page. Navigating the hierarchy of thumbnail pages is made explicit by
forward and backward links. Users can navigate through a group of images
via "previous" and "next" links. It is completely compatible with picture
directories and MySQL databases from previous versions.

making it fast for low-end systems. Temporaries are avoided because of
this. The produced code is similar to hand-coded code, but the quality of
the code still depends on the compiler and its version. The dimensions for
vectors and matrices are static and bounded at compile time using template
arguments. 

Changes: A namespace bug was fixed, the doxygen docs were slighly
improved, and a doxygen tag file was added.

[078] - UgLy Game Search Engine Beta 6
  by UgLyPuNk (http://freshmeat.net/users/UgLyPuNk/)
  Tuesday, July 9th 2002 02:11

Games/Entertainment
System :: Monitoring

About: The UgLy Game Search Engine quickly searches the network for game
servers, and then lists them in a qstat-formatted file and html for use by
other programs, such as Server Query and Gametrakker. The script itself
uses very little memory and bandwidth and will happily run in the
background. It supports games such as Quake 1/2/3, Unreal, Jedi Knight 2,
Half Life, and many more.

Changes: Added RRDTool support for real time graphing of players online, a
function for disabling the scan for people who just want it to look at
static servers, an option to run from cron (when not searching for
Tribes/Tribes 2), and a few more file checks. A big memory hole was also
fixed.

[010] - DBConnect API 0.2.1
  by Johnathan Ingram (http://freshmeat.net/users/jingram/)
  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 17:20

Categories: Database, Software Development, Software Development ::
Libraries

About: DBConnect (Database Connect) API is an easy to  use C++ object API
to allow applications to  connect to databases. Your DB applications can 
now become cross platformed and cross  databased. The API currently
implements MySQL,  Oracle8, and PostGreSQL drivers in a Unix environment
and MySQL, Oracle8, and ODBC in a Windows environment.

Changes: The linking bug under Redhat 7.1 gcc 2.97.x for the example apps
has been fixed. The home directory directive has been split into separate
include and lib directives for the configure script. The OCI Oracle8 field
name extended copy bug in the Oracle8 driver has been fixed. The Oracle
driver has been ported to use the Oracle 8.0.5 distribution. The actual
object files for the DB distributions are no longer compiled into the
dbconn libs. The configure and make files have been ported to Solaris.

creates an HTML file  with statistical information of those postings. This 
includes a list of the longest threads, authors with  most postings,
operating systems and newsclients  used, and more. The inclusion of
person-related  information can be turned off to ensure privacy.  The
program is distributed as an executable JAR  that also contains the source
code. Also included in the distribution are several tools to process news
postings: sort and count them, remove duplicates, list information on
postings, grep and filter them.

Changes: Message files in rnews format are now read. HTML output quality
was improved (table summaries and meta elements were added, and standards
conformance and readability were improved). Program parameters can now be
used to exclude the various statistics sections. New directory mode can
create statistics for a complete archive of Usenet postings. Output
filename is now automatically created from month, year, and input filename
if not explicitly specified.

About:  libbadpenguin is a small static library used in many utilities that
are part of the "Bad Penguin" GNU/Linux distribution. It provides functions
to manage the filesystem, doubly-linked lists (chains), the terminal
(cursor and color), and to handle TAR archives. The goal of libbadpenguin
is to speed up the development of console tools and utilities without
requiring big static libraries such as 'ncurses' or 'GNU glib'. It is
intended to be as small as possibile in order to be linked statically to
avoid dependency problems. It includes a scripts directory, which is a
collection of scripts from other binaries and the configuration tool from
"Bad Penguin". It provides scripts to manage the filesystem and to automate
some user operations. One particular script is "untar", which is used as a
frontend to explode the most common archive formats like rpm, deb, tgz,
bzipped files, and more.

Changes: Extract tar archive function modified to display better error
messages.

parser that uses libgringo to replace cdialog. It was  written to make some
configuration scripts work  both in console and under X-Window without any 
modification. gringosh also provides features more  powerfull than cdialog
- for example, the ability to  have more than two buttons per form.

Changes: Segmentation fault on ncurses due to gringo_Quit() function not
being re-entrant has been fixed. Listbox and gridbox now display the
selected item when the console does not have focus.

  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 07:23

Categories: System :: Installation/Setup, Utilities

About: libhardware is a very small static library used in many utilities
that are part of Antonio Gallo's (AGX) GNU/Linux distribution, "Bad
Penguin". It provides functions to access information about your system
hardware, to detect the hardware, and to handle kernel modules
automatically. It is able to enumerate all PCI devices, enumerate all EIDE
disks and CDROMs, enumerate all SCSI disks and CDROMs,  enumerate all
EIDE/SCSI disk partitions, and check if a detected device is supported in
the Linux kernel using a custom PCI database. The included shell scripts
'probedisk' and 'probepart' detect disks, CDROMs, and partitions. The
included 'scanmodule' utility allows you to detect and load kernel module
automatically.

Changes: 'probedisk' added to display all HDs and CDROMs. 'probepart' added
to display all available partitions. 'scanmodule' added to display all
detected hardware. Database of working devices was heavily updated.

[056] - Port Scan Attack Detector 0.9.1
  by Michael Rash (http://freshmeat.net/users/michaelrash/)
  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 12:11

Categories: System :: Networking :: Firewalls, System :: Networking ::
Monitoring

About: Port Scan Attack Detector (psad) is a program written in Perl that
is designed to work with Linux firewalling code (iptables in the 2.4.x
kernels, and ipchains in the 2.2.x kernels) to detect port scans. It
features a set of highly configurable danger thresholds (with sensible
defaults provided), verbose alert messages that include the source,
destination, scanned port range, begin and end times, TCP flags and
corresponding nmap options (Linux 2.4.x kernels only), email alerting, and
automatic blocking of offending IP addresses via dynamic configuration of
ipchains/iptables firewall rulesets. In addition, for the 2.4.x kernels
psad incorporates many of the TCP signatures included in Snort to detect
highly suspect scans for various backdoor programs (e.g. EvilFTP,
GirlFriend, SubSeven), DDoS tools (mstream, shaft), and advanced port scans
(syn, fin, Xmas) which are easily leveraged against a machine via nmap. 

Changes: A man page was added. Deep scans are now detected properly. A set
of benchmarks was added. Regex processing of packet strings was made
faster. whois calls were wrapped with SIGALRM. A security bugfix was made
in config file processing. A bug in local port lookups for signature
processing was fixed.

[057] - pwPage 10 Second Database Forms 11.16.00 (Production / Stable)
  by Phil Welch (http://freshmeat.net/users/PhilmoreW/)
  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 17:08

About: pwPage provides an extremely fast and simple approach to the
creation of database forms. If a database table exists and a corresponding
HTML page has been constructed  using a few easy guidelines, pwPage can
immediately be used for table data selections, insertions, updates,
deletions, and selectable table content reviewing by simply adding a
symbolic link  to pwPage.cgi.  Written in C, it refutes the XML contention 
that HTML cannot be reliably parsed and therefore used for both input and
output. The number of  pages pwPage can support is only limited by your
available disk space. pwPage is compatible with MS Frontpage and similar
site development tools.  The Java rendition enables an entire web site, 
including security, dynamically formatted forms-based web pages, etc., to
be provided using a single servlet without the use of XML.

Management :: Link Checking, System :: Networking

About: RabbIt is the mutating, caching webproxy which is used to speed up
surfing over slow links like modems. It does this by removing advertising
and background images and scaling down images to low quality JPEGs. RabbIT
is written in Java and should be able to run on any platform. It does
depend upon an image converter if imagescaleing is on. The recommended
image converter is "convert" from the ImageMagick package.

Changes: Some long methods have been broken into several smaller ones for
better readability. Documentation has been updated and added. The
metahandlers have been pooled, since it was possible with a minor patch.
The program has been run through jmp (a Java memory profiler) to find and
close some leaks. Certain objects are nulled in an attempt to help the
garbage collector. CacheStatus has been updated to show the number of
entries in the cache. The problems with proxy authorization for an upstream
proxy if RabbIT is part of a proxy chain have been fixed. The link has been
updated to ignore anchors. Setup is called only once for MIME type
handlers.

  by Howard Ship (http://freshmeat.net/users/hship/)
  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 18:53

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content, Software Development

About: Tapestry is a rich, component-based object model for developing
dynamic, highly interactive Web applications. It simplifies Web application
development by organizing an application into pages of components. Tapestry
takes care of all the "plumbing" of a Web application, including generating
URLs and responding to links and form submissions. This means that the code
written by developers is almost all application specific. Tapestry includes
a complete Java build environment, based on GNU Make, extensive
documentation, and tutorial/demonstration source code.

Changes: Helper beans are now more useful. The NumericField component has
been improved. Object pols now cull out unused objects after a while. The
ShowInspector component now uses Flash, and uses DHTML to position the icon
in the lower-right corner. Tapestry now bundles Jetty 3.1RC9 and is
compatible with JBoss 2.4.0. The documentation has been extensively
improved, including more UML diagrams.

[071] - the Anomy mail sanitizer 1.43
  by Juggler (http://freshmeat.net/users/juggler/)
  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 16:32

Categories: Communications :: Email :: Filters, Security

About: The Anomy mail sanitizer is a filter designed to block email-based
security risks, such as trojans and viruses. It can scan an arbitrarily
complex RFC822 or MIME message and remove or rename attachments, truncate
unusually long MIME header fields and sanitize HTML by disabling
Javascript, etc. It uses a single-pass pure Perl MIME parser, which can
make it both more efficient and more precise than other similar programs.
The sanitizer has built-in support for third-party virus scanners.

Changes: Adding LINK and FRAMESET tags to list of defanged HTML tags, and
fixes for logging bugs and charset and character mangling related issues.
This release completes the refactoring of the Sanitizer from a monolithic
script to a more OO design.

Categories: Internet, Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Dynamic Content, Internet ::
WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: tNews is a set of PHP4 scripts designed to provide easy-to-use basic
news headline support for websites. The system uses HTML-based templates to
specify formatting of news pages, providing complete control of page
appearance to the webmaster. The system's backend is provided by a MySQL

pages. News HTML pages are only regenerated when changes are made to news
headlines, so end users suffer no delays caused by database access or
parsing of scripting code. All administration and setup is done through a
Web-based interface, so no editing of text files is required.

Changes: This release fixes bugs that prevented editing categories from
working.

  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 13:06

Categories: Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: HTTP Servers, System :: Networking

About: uIP is a stripped down implementation of the TCP/IP protocol stack
with a very low overhead; the code footprint is on the order of a few
kilobytes and RAM usage is on the order of a few hundred bytes. uIP is
intended to be used in embedded systems running low end 8- and 16-bit
microcontrollers.

[076] - Wackamole 1.0.0

  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 05:07

Categories: System :: Clustering/Distributed Networks, System ::
Networking, System :: Networking :: Monitoring, System :: Networking ::
Monitoring :: Hardware Watchdog

About: Wackamole is a tool that helps with making a  cluster highly
available. It manages a bunch of  virtual IPs that should be available to
the outside   world at all times, and ensures that exactly one  machine
within the cluster is listening on each  virtual IP address that Wackamole
manages. If it  discovers that particular machines within the  cluster are
not alive, it will almost immediately  ensure that other machines acquire
the virtual IP  addresses the down machines were managing. At  no time will
more than one connected machine be   responsible for any virtual IP.

[077] - Webcpp 0.2.1 (Stable)
  by Jeffrey Bakker (http://freshmeat.net/users/staeryatz/)
  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 13:29

Categories: Education, Software Development :: Documentation, Utilities

About: Webcpp is a command line utility that takes your C, C++, Java, PERL,
or Unix shell code, and converts it into an HTML file using a fully
customizable syntax highlighting engine. This may be useful if you want to
post your code examples on the Web, or make online programming tutorials.
It can also generate an HTML from other text-based files, and can even
convert UNIX text to DOS.

Changes: A missing symlink in the source tarball which was causing the
install scripts to fail has been fixed. The dupe option, which has been
broken for the last two releases, has also been fixed. Perl and shell
highlighting should now be much more effective. The webcpp UI shell script
has been updated to work better with 0.2x. Internal enhancements have been
made to the SCS engine, and some of the file I/O routines were redone using
the new cfour file class.

[087] - Zinc 3.1.27 (initial)
  by Yannick Jestin (http://freshmeat.net/users/izn0g/)
  Tuesday, September 4th 2001 07:12

About: Zinc is a Tk widget developed with Perl/Tk, Tcl/Tk and Python/Tk
bindings. Zinc widgets are very similar to Tk canvases in that they support
structured graphics. Graphical items can be manipulated, and bindings can
be associated with them to implement interaction behaviors. But unlike the
canvas, zinc can structure the items in a hierarchy, and has support for
affine 2D transforms. Clipping can be set for sub-trees of the item
hierarchy and the item set is quite more powerful, including field-specific
items for Air Traffic systems. Zinc is fast enough to allow the
implementation of 2k2k radar displays with smooth animations. It is
structured enough to allow the implementation of direct manipulation
desktop GUIs.  

Changes: Debian woody compliance, bugfix in sensibility on tabular and
track, and gradient syntax modification (-fillcolor) added. itemcget and
itemconfigure corrected to return an array instead of an array ref.
