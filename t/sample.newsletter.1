description:
tpctl is a configuration tool for IBM ThinkPad laptop computers (only).
It does some of the things under Linux that PS2.EXE does under DOS and
that the ThinkPad Configuration program does under Windows. tpctl
provides access to all of the functionality of the IBM SMAPI BIOS as
documented in the IBM ThinkPad Technical Reference manuals. It can also
configure some parallel and serial port resources and display certain
information from the CMOS RAM. Check the tpctl homepage for the latest
list of capabilities. So far it has been found to work on at least the
following ThinkPad models: 380D, 380Z, 560E, 600, 600E, 770, 770ED,
770X.

changes:
This is the first "stable" release. If you downloaded a version of
tpctl prior to 0.6.0 then it is recommended that you upgrade. Bugs have
been fixed, features added, and installation has become easier (I
hope). Please tell me how the program installs and runs on your
ThinkPad!

access or share almost any kind of information, without the complexity
or costs of other intranet/groupware packages.

changes:
Various small bugfixes and typos squashed. Fixes broken attachment
sending to picky MUA's (like qmail). Version 1.0.2 was not released,

Micro Unix News (http://mu.current.nu) is opening soon, and we could use some contributing authors. Topics will be Wearables, Routers, basically anything that runs UNIX that isn't a workstation or a server or small devices and hardware that runs UNIX-like OS's. If you're interested in becoming a contributing author, and would like to keep an eye out for news on the small unix, embedded scene let me
know (mailto:rob@freshmeat.net). Hit the details link for a list of the topics that will be discussed.

description:
Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other
non-source files of a program from the program's source files. Make
gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file called the
makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and how to compute
it from other files. When you write a program, you should write a
makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make to build and
install the program.

changes:
New jobserver algorithm to avoid a possible hole where we could miss
SIGCHLDs and get into a deadlock and some cleanups.

some sysop utilities.

description:
The textutils package resembles the GNU text file (actually, file
contents) processing utilities. Most of these programs have significant
advantages over their Unix counterparts, such as greater speed,
additional options, and fewer arbitrary limits. The programs that can
be built with this package are cat, cksum, comm, csplit, cut, expand,
fmt, fold, head, join, md5sum, nl, od, paste, pr, sort, split, sum,
tac, tail, tr, unexpand, uniq, and wc.

changes:
Portability fixes based largely on tar-1.13 reports and `tail
--pid=PID' now works even when PID belongs to some other user.

description:
Sentinel is a fast file scanner similar to Tripwire or Viper with built
in authentication using the RIPEMD 160 bit MAC hashing function. It
uses a single database similar to Tripwire, maintains file integrity
using the RIPEMD algorithm and also produces secure, signed logfiles.
Its main design goal is to detect intruders modifying files. It also
prevents intruders with root/superuser permissions from tampering with
its log files and database. Disclaimer: this is not a security toolkit.
It is a single purpose file/drive scanning program. Available versions
are for linux (tested on all current Slackware and RedHat releases),
with Irix versions soon to be added on.

changes:
This release fixes 2 known bugs in v1.1.2c and 1 known bug in v1.1.4c.
In addition it implements a new batchfile creation function which was
disabled in v1.1.6c correctly and adds an automated test script to the
package. This brings the level of stability to the same level as the
1.0.x series and is probably the last 1.1.x series release. It also
adds improvements to the documentation, and improves the help messages
shown in case of an error.

 download: http://apps.freshmeat.net/download/933544440/

body:
The version of samba as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 has a couple of security problems including a Denial-of-Service attack against nmbd, it was possible to exploit smbd if you had a message command defined which used the %f or %M formatter, smbmnt's check to see if a user is allowed to create a mount was flawed
which allowed users to mount at arbitraty mountpoints in the filesystem. These problems have been fixed in version 2.0.5a-1. The smbfsx package is also obsolete with this update and has been replaced by smbfs, which can handle both 2.0 and 2.2 kernels now.
The fixed packages are available here (http://security.debian.org/dists/stable/updates/).

 homepage: http://apps.freshmeat.net/homepage/933515796/

body:
The Aglet Software Development Kit is a framework for researching
and developing mobile agents and distributed systems. It was one
of the first of its kind available in the world, and is still a leader in
its field in terms of technology. Recently though, there are rumours that IBM might discontinue the project and shelve the technology. This would be a great loss to the growing Aglet community and the mobile code world in general. We are asking for your help in convincing IBM that Aglets should live on, as an Open Source project. It is ideal for this, with the community already developing and releasing OSS updates and packages for the framework.

You can help us by signing our petition (http://luckyspc.lboro.ac.uk/Aglets/Petition) and registering your support. Even if you don't know anything about Aglets, you can still help.

The Intelligent Backup System (ibs) is designed to be a painless and

program, it backs up only those files that have changed since being
installed. In the event of data loss, ibs makes it possible to
reinstall "clean" packages and restore all local and customized files
from an archive. Because it only backs up files that have been
modified, ibs uses fewer resources than many other backup systems, and
the process of creating, maintaining, and restoring backups with ibs is
often more convenient and less complex than using traditional methods.

as well as many other fixes and enhancements. Support for Red Hat is

description:
pvmsync is a distributed operating system which provides
synchronization mechanisms (mutexes, semaphores, and condition
variables) and shared data (integer, floating point, and a raw memory
block) to processes distributed throughout a beowulf cluster. The idea
is to facilitate communications between processes running on a beowulf
cluster in the form of shared data. Please see the README for further
details.

changes:
Added garbage collection to the tcp daemon (pvmsyncd). By default, all
objects that haven't been accessed for 1/2 hour will be removed. By
specifying the -t cmdline option, you can set the timeout to your
tastes. Also, the -T option turns off this feature. In addition, a bug
was fixed where queries for already existing objects would go ignored.

basis for managing print jobs and queues. The Line Printer Daemon (LPD,
RFC1179), Server Message Block (SMB), and AppSocket protocols are also
supported with reduced functionality. CUPS adds network printer
browsing and PostScript Printer Description ("PPD")-based printing
options to support real world applications under UNIX and a customized
version of GNU GhostScript.
