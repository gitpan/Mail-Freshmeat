description:
smtm (Show Me The Money) is a configurable Perl/Tk stock ticker and an
aggregate profit/loss display that can be used for stocks from around
the world. smtm displays the name of the company, the most recent price
and both absolute and relative price changes. If the number of shares
held is supplied, a net wealth change is also displayed. Foreign
currencies are recognised via cross-currency pairs to translate into
domestic units. Stocks can be added and deleted, and the selection can
be stored. smtm is being used with US, Canadian, British, French and
German stocks.

changes:
Additional specification of number of shares held as well as the (ISO)
cross-currency pair to map into domestic monies, use of this info to
display net portfolio gain or loss in window title, an additional
option --wide and a menu selector for `wide' display with per-share
gain or loss and total holdings, underlining of menu shortcuts for
ALT-x, and more code cleanups.

description:
DeleGate is a multi-purpose application level gateway, or a proxy
server which runs on multiple platforms (Unix, Windows and OS/2).
DeleGate mediates communication of various protocols (HTTP, FTP, NNTP,
POP, Telnet, etc.), applying cache and conversion for mediated data,
controlling access from clients and routing toward servers. It
translates protocols between clients and servers, merging several
servers into a single server view with aliasing and filtering. Born as
a tiny proxy for Gopher in March 1994, it has steadily grown into a
general purpose proxy server. Besides proxy, DeleGate can be used as a
simple origin server for some protocols (HTTP, FTP and NNTP).

changes:
Major security bugs fixed and new security features added.

description:
PyGCS is a very stripped down MUD-like chat-server written entirely in
Python. It has a single "room" and no large database to keep in memory
and on disk. PyGCS has no embedded programming language. PyGCS is
ideally meant to be a small multi-user real-time chat system for people
who have a need to talk to more than one person at a time online. It
fits somewhere in between the setup IRC uses (no walking between rooms
so to speak) and the MUCK/MUSH/MOO style of server.

Internal Python docstrings added. Other internal code cleanup. Help
index fixed to include dirsay.

Blade's MP3 Encoder (BladeEnc) is a freeware MP3 encoder. It is based
on the same ISO compression routines as mpegEnc, so you can expect
roughly the same, or better, quality. The main difference is the
appearance and speed. BladeEnc doesn't have a nice, user-friendly
interface like mpegEnc, but it is more than three times faster, and it
works with several popular front-end graphical user interfaces.

where a certain file may be found, a collision test with renaming
avoids aborting of mkisofs, and multiuser safety by use of a locking
protocol.

 added by: scoop on Dec 07th 1999, 17:56
 category: Debian

 homepage: http://www.debian.org
 download: http://security.debian.org/dists/stable/updates/

body:
The version of sendmail that was distributed with Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 has a slight problem in the code to regenerate the aliases database. Sendmail allowed any user to run sendmail with the -bi option to (re)initialize the aliases database. The user could then interrupt sendmail and leave the system with a broken aliases database. This has been fixed in version 8.9.3-3slink1 by only allowing root and trusted users to regenerate the aliases database.
An updated package is available from security.debian.org (http://security.debian.org/dists/stable/updates/).

To mark the imminent release of version 1.0 of XDBM, an entirely free embedded database for XML, Bowerbird Computing and O'Reilly and Associates have announced a hacker competition (http://www.bowerbird.com.au/competition/). Because Bowerbird Computing pays royalties to everyone who contributes time, code or consulting services to any of their projects, every entrant will receive a share of the revenue earned by Bowerbird Computing.  But as an extra incentive O'Reilly and Associates will give a voucher for ten of their excellent hacker manuals to the author of the most creative and usefull entry.

description:
pngcrush is an excellent batch-mode compression utility for PNG images.
Depending on the application that created the original PNGs, it can

the largest reductions in file size, those created with the GIMP at its
highest compression setting will see little or no improvement. The
utility also allows specified PNG chunks (e.g. text comments) to be
deleted, and it can fix incorrect gamma info written by Photoshop 5.0.

rendering intents other than 0. This release uses libpng beta version

LM Sensors, SCSI, IDE, PCI, Ethernet, Floppy, and Video.

description:
FtpLocate is a fast FTP search engine written with Perl. It supports
indexing on multiple FTP servers and generates summaries for them.
FtpLocate provides the user two methods for searching: filename search
and description search. Filename search groups the results by FTP
servers, displaying the server nearest to the client first. With
description search, a user can find the files he wants without knowing
the filename. Files with same description will be grouped together.

changes:
A file description generater, file description search support, a user
access log, and speed improvements (by using the glimpse as indexer).

description:
Bastille Linux aims to be the most comprehensive, flexible and
educational Security Hardening Program for Red Hat Linux. Virtually
every task it performs is optional, providing immense flexibility. It
also educates the user regarding the topic at hand before asking any
question. The interactive nature allows the program to be more thorough
when securing, while the educational component produces an admin who is
less likely to compromise the increased security.

changes:
Lots of little bug fixes, and the start of a code freeze.

description:
memtester is a user-space utility for testing the memory subsystem in a
computer to determine if it is faulty. It does a reasonably good job of
finding intermittent faults and non-deterministic faults. It has many
tests to help catch borderline memory, and generates a verbose report
of faults found, tests run, and time taken.

changes:
A couple of small bits in the documentation were fixed to bring it up
to date. One error message was made more informational.

It still has a long way to go, but unlike other Slashdot clones it
doesn't require SQL.

changes:
Initial Release.
