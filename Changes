     - Several cosmetic touchups
     - Some code refactoring
     - There have been some further very minor interface adjustments to
       accomodate for some newsletter irregularities. total is now
       details_total, entry's posted_by has been split into posted_by_name
       and posted_by_url. Fields that are now specified in the newsletter
       now return '' instead of 'Not specified'
     - Better newsletter parsing, and improved error checking
     - More tests :-)
     - Reduced the size of the distribution tarball in half
     - Added support for newsletter "articles", see POD
     - Updated the POD with more documentation
     - Fixed a suble bug with parse_entry_version
