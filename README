                           Mail::Freshmeat
                           ===============

Mail::Freshmeat is a parser for the daily newsletters from
<http://freshmeat.net/>.


Uses
----

See <http://www.new.ox.ac.uk/~adam/computing/fmscore/> for what may be
the only sensible application of this module.  (Quick summary: fmscore
is a Perl5 program which uses Mail::Freshmeat to parse freshmeat daily
e-mail newsletters, and then rank them by interest according to highly
flexible user-supplied ranking rules. Articles below a specified score
will be removed from the output. fmscore is ideal for use as a
procmail filter.)
